{"questions":[{"id":"q-675","question":"You manage a two-region AWS deployment (us-east-1, us-west-2) behind an ALB with private subnets, NAT gateway, and RDS in us-east-1. During business hours, us-west-2 exhibits spike in 5xx errors and higher latency. Outline immediate incident triage steps, AWS CLI commands to run, how you’d identify root causes (NAT saturation, DNS routing, cross-region replication lag), and both short- and long-term mitigations with verification steps?","answer":"Start by verifying scope in CloudWatch and X-Ray, then check ALB target health, NAT gateway quotas, and RDS latency across regions. Collect logs, compare regional error rates, and run a quick failover","explanation":"## Why This Is Asked\nThis question evaluates incident triage skills in a real multi-region AWS setup, focusing on identifying root causes under pressure, deciding rapid mitigations, and confirming with telemetry. It tests familiarity with ALB, NAT, RDS, Route53, and CloudWatch/X-Ray.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Multi-region deployment\n- Incident triage\n- ALB, NAT gateway, RDS latency\n- CloudWatch, VPC Flow Logs, X-Ray\n- DR planning\n\n## Code Example\n```javascript\n// Pseudo-logic for triage steps in a real incident\nfunction triage(incident) {\n  // fetch metrics from CloudWatch and X-Ray\n  // check ALB target health and NAT quotas\n  // identify root cause and apply mitigation\n}\n```\n\n## Follow-up Questions\n- Which metrics would you alert on for cross-region failures?\n- How would you automate the triage workflow?","diagram":"flowchart TD\n  A[Incident] --> B[Triage]\n  B --> C{Root Cause?}\n  C --> D[NAT Saturation]\n  C --> E[DNS/Routing]\n  C --> F[RDS/Replication Lag]\n  D --> G[Mitigate: scale NAT]\n  E --> H[Mitigate: Route53 routing]\n  F --> I[Mitigate: DR drill]","difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["aws-sysops"],"channel":"aws-sysops","subChannel":"general","sourceUrl":null,"videos":{"shortVideo":null,"longVideo":null},"companies":["Apple","Snowflake"],"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-11T14:46:56.102Z","createdAt":"2026-01-11T14:46:56.102Z"}],"subChannels":["general"],"companies":["Apple","Snowflake"],"stats":{"total":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"newThisWeek":1}}
