Describe the algorithm and data structures you would use.","answer":"Implement a token bucket or sliding window algorithm using Redis for distributed rate limiting with per-user and per-endpoint limits.","explanation":"For API rate limiting, I would implement a token bucket algorithm using Redis as the distributed store. The token bucket maintains a bucket of tokens for each user/IP/endpoint combination, refilling at a fixed rate. Each request consumes one token, and if the bucket is empty, the request is rejected. Redis provides atomic operations like INCR and EXPIRE that are perfect for this use case. The data structure would be a Redis hash keyed by user ID + endpoint, storing the current token count and last refill timestamp. For example, a user might be allowed 100 requests per minute, with the bucket refilling at 100/60 tokens per second. This approach handles distributed systems well since Redis provides consistency across multiple server instances. I would also implement a sliding window counter for more precise control, tracking requests in the last N seconds using Redis sorted sets with timestamps as scores. The implementation should include different tiers of limits - per-user, per-API key, and per-endpoint - with appropriate HTTP headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset) to inform clients about their current usage status.","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["rate-limiting","api-design","redis","distributed-systems","backend"],"channel":"backend","subChannel":"api-design","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":["Google","Amazon","Twitter","Stripe","GitHub"],"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2025-12-27T11:23:57.938Z","createdAt":"2025-12-27T11:23:57.938Z"},{"id":"q-614","question":"How would you implement API rate limiting for a high-traffic service that needs to handle millions of requests per minute? Discuss the trade-offs between different algorithms and your approach for distributed systems.","answer":"Implement rate limiting using a combination of token bucket algorithm with Redis for distributed state management, along with local caching for performance.","explanation":"API rate limiting is crucial for protecting services from abuse and ensuring fair resource allocation. For a high-traffic system, I'd implement a multi-layered approach: First, use the token bucket algorithm as it provides flexibility with burst capacity while maintaining average rate limits. The algorithm works by maintaining a bucket of tokens that refill at a fixed rate - each request consumes one token, allowing bursts when the bucket has tokens but enforcing long-term rate limits.\n\nFor distributed systems, store the state in Redis using atomic operations (INCR/EXPIRE or Lua scripts) to ensure consistency across multiple servers. Redis provides single-digit millisecond latency and built-in expiration, making it ideal for rate limiting data. To optimize performance, implement a two-tier caching strategy: local in-memory cache for frequently accessed clients with periodic synchronization to Redis, and Redis as the source of truth.\n\nThe key trade-offs are: Token bucket vs. sliding window - token bucket is simpler and allows bursts, while sliding window provides more precise control but is computationally expensive. Fixed window counter is easiest to implement but can allow double the rate limit at window boundaries. For distributed systems, centralized storage (Redis) ensures accuracy but becomes a bottleneck; distributed approaches improve scalability but may have slight inconsistencies.\n\nReal-world implementation would include: rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset), different limits per endpoint/user tier, and graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable (fall back to local limits with reduced capacity). Companies like Twitter use sophisticated rate limiting with multiple dimensions (user, app, endpoint), while Stripe implements rate limiting to prevent API abuse and ensure service stability.","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["rate-limiting","api-design","distributed-systems","redis","token-bucket","scalability"],"channel":"backend","subChannel":"api-gateway","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":["Google","Meta","Twitter","Stripe","Amazon","Netflix"],"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2025-12-28T03:49:51.678Z","createdAt":"2025-12-28T03:49:51.678Z"},{"id":"q-624","question":"How would you implement API rate limiting in a distributed system to prevent abuse while ensuring fair usage across multiple servers?","answer":"Implement a centralized rate limiter using Redis with distributed token bucket or sliding window algorithms, synchronized across all API servers to maintain consistent limits.","explanation":"API rate limiting in distributed systems requires careful coordination to maintain consistent limits across multiple servers. The most effective approach uses Redis as a centralized store for rate limiting data. The token bucket algorithm works well here: each user receives a bucket of tokens that refill at a fixed rate. When a request arrives, you check for available tokens in Redis using atomic operations like INCR or Lua scripts.

The most common approaches are token bucket and sliding window algorithms. Token bucket allows bursts while maintaining a steady rate - clients accumulate tokens over time and consume them for each request. Sliding window tracks requests within a time window, providing more precise control. For distributed systems, Redis is ideal as it provides atomic operations and fast access across multiple servers. Implementation typically involves middleware that checks client identifiers (API keys, IP addresses) against stored usage data before processing requests. Key considerations include setting appropriate limits (requests per minute/hour), handling burst traffic, providing clear error responses with retry-after headers, and implementing different tiers for various client types.
