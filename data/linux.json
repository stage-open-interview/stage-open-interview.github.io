{"questions":[{"id":"gh-26","question":"What are the essential Linux commands every DevOps engineer should master for system administration, troubleshooting, and automation?","answer":"Core Linux commands include: file operations (ls, cp, mv, rm), text processing (grep, sed, awk, cut), process management (ps, top, kill, nice), network tools (netstat, curl, wget, ssh), permissions (chmod, chown, chgrp), package management (apt, yum, dnf), and system monitoring (df, du, free, iostat). These form the foundation for shell scripting and DevOps automation.","explanation":"## Interview Context\nThis question tests fundamental Linux proficiency required for DevOps roles. Interviewers want to see practical knowledge beyond basic commands.\n\n## Key Areas to Cover\n- **File System Operations**: Navigation, manipulation, permissions\n- **Process Management**: Monitoring, controlling, prioritizing\n- **Network Tools**: Diagnostics, data transfer, remote access\n- **Text Processing**: Pattern matching, data extraction, transformation\n- **System Monitoring**: Resource usage, performance analysis\n\n## Code Examples\n```bash\n# Find and kill processes by name\nps aux | grep 'nginx' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9\n\n# Monitor system resources in real-time\ntop -p $(pgrep nginx) -d 2\n\n# Network troubleshooting\nnetstat -tulpn | grep :80\ncurl -I https://api.example.com/health\n```\n\n## Follow-up Questions\n1. How would you write a shell script to automatically restart a service if it's not running?\n2. What's the difference between `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` for text processing?\n3. How would you troubleshoot high CPU usage on a Linux server?","diagram":"\ngraph TD\n    Linux --> Files[File Ops: ls, cp, mv]\n    Linux --> Sys[System: top, df, ps]\n    Linux --> Text[Text: grep, awk, sed]\n","difficulty":"beginner","tags":["linux","shell"],"channel":"linux","subChannel":"commands","sourceUrl":null,"videos":{"shortVideo":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB_3FIGRWRU"},"companies":["Amazon","Cloudflare","Google","Hashicorp","Microsoft","Netflix"],"eli5":"Imagine you're the boss of a giant playground with lots of toys and games. Linux commands are like your magic words to control everything! 'ls' is like looking at all your toys on the shelf. 'cp' is like making copies of your favorite drawings. 'mv' is like moving toys to different boxes. 'grep' is like finding specific words in your storybooks. 'ps' is like checking which friends are playing on the swings. 'curl' is like sending secret messages to other playgrounds. 'chmod' is like deciding who can play with which toys - you, your friends, or everyone. These magic words help you keep the playground running smoothly, fix broken toys, and make games happen automatically while you eat snacks!","relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"lastUpdated":"2025-12-24T16:41:59.319Z","createdAt":"2025-12-26 12:51:05"},{"id":"q-466","question":"You're debugging a production Linux server where processes are randomly dying with 'Out of memory' errors, but `free -m` shows 8GB available RAM.
