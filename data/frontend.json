It's perfect for form inputs, toggles, and basic UI state. For example, `const [count, setCount] = useState(0)` is straightforward and readable.\n\nuseReducer shines when dealing with complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one in a more complex way. It follows the Redux pattern with actions and reducers, making state transitions more predictable and easier to test. For instance, managing a shopping cart with add, remove, and update operations is better suited for useReducer:\n\n```javascript\nconst cartReducer = (state, action) => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'ADD_ITEM':\n      return { ...state, items: [...state.items, action.payload] };\n    case 'REMOVE_ITEM':\n      return { ...state, items: state.items.filter(item => item.id !== action.payload) };\n    default:\n      return state;\n  }\n};\n```\n\nChoose useReducer when: state has multiple related values, state updates follow complex patterns, you need predictable state transitions, or you want to make state logic more testable.
