Run three etcd members, one on each control-plane node\n\nEtcd quorum requires a majority of members to be healthy. With three members, the majority is 2, so if one control-plane node fails, the remaining two etcd members still form a quorum and the cluster continues to operate. \n\n## Why Other Options Are Wrong\n- A: A single etcd member cannot maintain quorum if it fails, breaking HA.\n- C: Five members across two nodes is not feasible and would still risk quorum loss if nodes fail; etcd should be spread across distinct nodes for HA.\n- D: Etcd data must be persisted on disk; in-memory only would lose state on restart and is not HA.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Etcd quorum and HA require an odd number of members\n- Distributing etcd across control-plane nodes supports resilience\n- Persistent storage for etcd is essential\n- Use a load-balanced API endpoint to keep API access stable\n\n## Real-World Application\n- For a production-grade small cluster, deploy a 3-member etcd cluster across the 3 control-plane nodes and front the API with a load balancer to maintain availability during node failures.","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["Kubernetes","kubeadm","etcd","HA","AWS","Terraform","certification-mcq","domain-weight-25"],"channel":"cka","subChannel":"cluster-arch","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-12T04:48:30.465Z","createdAt":"2026-01-12 04:48:31"},{"id":"cka-cluster-arch-1768193310463-1","question":"In a 3-control-plane HA cluster behind a DNS load balancer, the API server certificate SANs currently include only control-plane IPs.

Recreate the cluster using --apiserver-cert-extra-sans to include the DNS name\n\nThe API server certificate must include SAN entries for any DNS names used to access the cluster. If the DNS name k8s-api.example.com is not present in the certificate, TLS handshakes fail when clients connect via that name. Regenerate or rotate the API server certificate to include the DNS SAN and apply the changes.\n\n## Why Other Options Are Wrong\n- B: Modifying hosts files does not fix TLS SAN validation and is not scalable for multi-client access.\n- C: Using IPs avoids DNS name usage but defeats the HA access pattern via DNS name and may still fail if IPs change.\n- D: Disabling TLS completely is insecure and not acceptable in production.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- TLS SAN and API server certificates\n- Control-plane endpoint DNS vs IPs\n- Certificate rotation for kubeadm-managed clusters\n\n## Real-World Application\n- When exposing the API via a DNS name behind a load balancer, ensure the certificate SAN includes that DNS name to prevent client TLS errors.","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["Kubernetes","kubeadm","etcd","HA","AWS","Terraform","certification-mcq","domain-weight-25"],"channel":"cka","subChannel":"cluster-arch","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-12T04:48:31.277Z","createdAt":"2026-01-12 04:48:31"},{"id":"cka-cluster-arch-1768193310463-2","question":"You want to enable encryption at rest for Kubernetes Secrets in a kubeadm-managed cluster.

Provide an encryption configuration file and pass it to the API server via --encryption-provider-config, then rotate keys to re-encrypt existing data\n\nTo enable encryption at rest for Secrets, you must configure the API server with an EncryptionConfig that specifies a provider (e.g., AES-CBC or a KMS provider) and restart the API server. After enabling, you typically rotate the encryption keys to re-encrypt existing data in etcd. This ensures secrets are stored encrypted at rest. \n\n## Why Other Options Are Wrong\n- B: Encryption at rest is configured via the API server, not by enabling encryption on etcd itself. \n- C: Keys should be managed by the encryption provider; storing keys in a Secret does not secure the data at rest. \n- D: Pod data encryption is not the standard method for Secrets; it’s about secret storage in etcd. \n\n## Key Concepts\n- Encryption provider configuration\n- API server certificate and TLS considerations not applicable here\n- Data at rest for secrets in etcd\n- Key rotation and re-encryption process\n\n## Real-World Application\n- In production, enable encryption at rest for Secrets to meet compliance requirements; implement a proper KMS-backed provider and plan key rotation.","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["Kubernetes","kubeadm","etcd","Encryption","AWS","Terraform","certification-mcq","domain-weight-25"],"channel":"cka","subChannel":"cluster-arch","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-12T04:48:31.677Z","createdAt":"2026-01-12 04:48:31"},{"id":"cka-troubleshoot-1768151801683-0","question":"A Deployment's pods crash with exit code 137 after the node experiences memory pressure, and the kubelet reports OOMKilled for the containers.
