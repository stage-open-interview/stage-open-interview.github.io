Stemming is computationally faster but can produce non-dictionary words (e.g., 'studies' becomes 'studi').

Choose stemming for search and retrieval applications where speed is prioritized, and lemmatization for analytical tasks that require accurate word forms and semantic meaning.","explanation":"## Key Differences\n**Tokenization**: The foundational step of text segmentation that breaks down text into discrete tokens, including words, subwords, punctuation, and other linguistic units.

The softmax weights determine how much each token attends to others. Positional encoding adds sequence information through sinusoidal functions: `PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/10000^(2i/d_model))` and `PE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/10000^(2i/d_model))`. This creates unique position embeddings that the model can learn relative position relationships from.\n\n## Code Example\n```python\ndef attention_with_positional_encoding(Q, K, V, pos_encoding):\n    # Add positional information to queries and keys\n    Q_pos = Q + pos_encoding\n    K_pos = K + pos_encoding\n    \n    # Scaled dot-product attention\n    scores = Q_pos @ K_pos.T / math.sqrt(d_k)\n    weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)\n    return weights @ V\n\n# Positional encoding generation\ndef get_positional_encoding(seq_len, d_model):\n    position = torch.arange(seq_len).unsqueeze(1)\n    div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, d_model, 2) * (-math.log(10000.0) / d_model))\n    pe = torch.zeros(seq_len, d_model)\n    pe[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term)\n    pe[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)\n    return pe\n```\n\n## Follow-up Questions\nHow does relative positional encoding differ from absolute?
