The pipeline employs STFT framing with overlapping windows (e.g., 50% overlap, 1024-point FFT) to capture time-frequency characteristics. A Kalman-filter-based approach updates the time-varying mixing matrix M(t), incorporating forgetting factors to track non-stationary mixing conditions while maintaining computational efficiency. The system dynamically selects between per-bin ICA for highly frequency-dependent mixing and joint diagonalization when coherent frequency bands are present, using a decision metric based on inter-frequency coherence and computational load. IMU and pose priors constrain the mixing matrix updates through geometric regularization, stabilizing permutation and scale ambiguities across time by anchoring source locations relative to the robot's coordinate frame. Drift is mitigated through adaptive forgetting factors and periodic re-initialization using sensor fusion data.
