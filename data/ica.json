{"questions":[{"id":"q-839","question":"**Advanced ICA Challenge**: Given a 3×N mixed signal matrix from sensors, outline a concrete plan to recover independent sources with FastICA. Include whitening steps, nonlinearity choice (e.g., g(u)=tanh(u)), convergence criteria, how you resolve sign/perm ambiguity, and how you compare to PCA on the same data. Include practical inputs and diagnostics?","answer":"Whiten X by centering and performing eigen-decomposition of the covariance, then apply the whitening matrix. Run FastICA with g(u)=tanh(u), iterating w <- E{X g(w^T X)} - E{g'(w^T X)} w and normalizin","explanation":"## Why This Is Asked\n\nAssesses ability to operationalize ICA in real data, including whitening, convergence, and handling ambiguities, plus evaluation against PCA.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n- Independent Component Analysis\n- Whitening and prewhitening\n- FastICA algorithm\n- Nonlinearity choices (tanh vs exp)\n- Identifiability: permutation and sign\n- PCA vs ICA diagnostics\n- Diagnostics: kurtosis, mutual information proxy\n\n## Code Example\n\n```javascript\n// Minimal sketch of FastICA update\nfunction fastICA(X, maxIter=200, tol=1e-6) {\n  // center and whiten\n  // iterative update\n}\n```\n\n## Follow-up Questions\n\n- How would you handle noisy mixtures or underdetermined cases?\n- How would you verify independence in practice?","diagram":null,"difficulty":"advanced","tags":["ica"],"channel":"ica","subChannel":"general","sourceUrl":null,"videos":{"shortVideo":null,"longVideo":null},"companies":["IBM","Two Sigma","Uber"],"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-12T13:24:00.767Z","createdAt":"2026-01-12T13:24:00.767Z"}],"subChannels":["general"],"companies":["IBM","Two Sigma","Uber"],"stats":{"total":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"newThisWeek":1}}
