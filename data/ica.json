The pipeline employs STFT framing with overlapping windows (e.g., 50% overlap, 1024-point FFT) to capture time-frequency characteristics. A Kalman-filter-based approach updates the time-varying mixing matrix M(t), incorporating forgetting factors to track non-stationary mixing conditions while maintaining computational efficiency. The system dynamically selects between per-bin ICA for highly frequency-dependent mixing and joint diagonalization when coherent frequency bands are present, using a decision metric based on inter-frequency coherence and computational load. IMU and pose priors constrain the mixing matrix updates through geometric regularization, stabilizing permutation and scale ambiguities across time by anchoring source locations relative to the robot's coordinate frame. Drift is mitigated through adaptive forgetting factors and periodic re-initialization using sensor fusion data.

The system must tolerate intermittent mic dropout, impulsive noise bursts, and a constrained CPU. Describe frame structure, whitening, demixing updates, per-bin vs joint diagonalization, dropout handling, latency targets, and evaluation plan (ground-truth SDR/SIR)?","answer":"Design a comprehensive online ICA pipeline for industrial 12-mic array: **Frame Structure**: 1024-point FFT at 48kHz (21.3ms frames), 75% overlap for 5.3ms hop size using Hann window squared for perfect reconstruction. 512 frequency bins, focus on 64-256 bins (500Hz-8kHz) covering robot motors (50-500Hz), alarms (1-4kHz), and speech (300Hz-4kHz). **Whitening**: Recursive PCA with exponential forgetting (λ=0.998) and eigenvalue regularization (λmin=0.001, λmax=100). Covariance matrix updates: C(t) = βC(t-1) + (1-β)x(t)x(t)^H where β=0.995 for stationary sources, β=0.98 for impulsive events. **Demixing Updates**: Online natural gradient with step-size adaptation: μ(t) = μ0/(1 + γ‖∇J‖) where μ0=0.01, γ=0.1. Dual averaging: fast component (α=0.99) for alarms/speech, slow component (α=0.999) for robot motors. **Per-bin vs Joint Diagonalization**: Per-bin ICA for bins <1kHz (high SNR, distinct spatial signatures), joint diagonalization across 4-8 adjacent bins for 1-6kHz range using generalized eigenvalue decomposition to exploit source coherence. **Dropout Handling**: Missing-data ICA with covariance interpolation: Ĉ = Σw_iC_i where weights based on signal coherence and recent frame history. Spatial smoothness prior: W(t) = 0.7W(t-1) + 0.3W_smooth where W_smooth uses neighboring mic responses. **Impulsive Noise**: Robust preprocessing with time-frequency masking: M(f,t) = 1/(1 + exp(α(|X(f,t)|-θ))) where α=2, θ=3σ_noise. Huber M-estimator with β=1.345 for gradient updates. **Latency & CPU**: Total latency 15ms (10ms frame + 5ms processing) using SIMD-optimized BLAS. CPU budget 12% single core at 2.4GHz through: (1) block processing 8 frames simultaneously, (2) reduced dimension via PCA to 8 components, (3) sparse matrix operations for demixing. **Evaluation**: Ground-truth SDR/SIR using calibrated sources: robot arm (known trajectory), alarm (test tones), speech (TIMIT sentences).

Dual forgetting factors adapt to different source dynamics.\n- **Demixing Updates**: Adaptive step-size natural gradient prevents divergence during impulsive events. Dual averaging tracks sources with different temporal characteristics simultaneously.\n- **Diagonalization Strategy**: Per-bin ICA exploits high SNR at low frequencies where sources have distinct spatial signatures. Joint diagonalization across frequency bins leverages source coherence in mid-range.\n- **Robustness**: Missing-data ICA with covariance interpolation maintains separation during mic dropout. Time-frequency masking suppresses impulsive noise before demixing.\n- **Performance**: 15ms latency meets real-time requirements for industrial monitoring. 12% CPU usage allows deployment on embedded systems.\n- **Evaluation**: Ground-truth metrics with controlled dropout scenarios validate system robustness under realistic failure conditions.","diagram":"flowchart TD\n  A[Frame] --> B[Whiten]\n  B --> C[Demixing Update]\n  C --> D[Permutation Tracking]\n  D --> E[Output Channels]","difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["ica"],"channel":"ica","subChannel":"general","sourceUrl":null,"videos":{"shortVideo":null,"longVideo":null},"companies":["Plaid","Tesla","Twitter"],"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":true,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-17T03:26:56.212Z","createdAt":"2026-01-15T04:12:12.896Z"},{"id":"q-2200","question":"Beginner ICA with reference signal: A 3-mic array records two overlapping speakers in a small classroom with moderate reverberation.
