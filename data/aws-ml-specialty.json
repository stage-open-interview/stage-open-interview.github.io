The signed package includes model weights, inference runtime, configuration files, and checksum verification.\n\n**Versioned Edge Manifest in S3:**\nPublish a versioned Edge Manifest to S3 containing deployment specifications, device compatibility matrix, and rollback configuration. Each manifest version is immutable and includes digital signatures for integrity verification.\n\n**Device Grouping Strategy:**\nSegment devices into logical groups: Canary (1% devices), Phase 1 (10% high-priority), Phase 2 (30% critical infrastructure), and Phase 3 (remaining 59%).

Devices cache update packages locally and apply when connectivity restores. Use exponential backoff for retry attempts.\n\n**Automated Rollback Triggers:**\nConfigure rollback triggers based on: model accuracy degradation (>5% drop), inference latency increase (>200ms), error rate spike (>3%), memory usage threshold (>80%), and telemetry anomalies.\n\n**Monitoring Strategy:**\nTrack model accuracy through validation datasets, monitor inference latency at the edge, and measure update success rates.
