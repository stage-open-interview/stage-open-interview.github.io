{"questions":[{"id":"snowflake-core-account-access-1768170043454-0","question":"You use SSO with Okta and MFA for interactive logins in Snowflake and you need a non-interactive service account for a daily ETL job running on AWS. Which authentication approach is recommended to minimize risk and simplify credential rotation?","answer":"[{\"id\":\"a\",\"text\":\"Create a dedicated Snowflake user with a password and MFA disabled\",\"isCorrect\":false},{\"id\":\"b\",\"text\":\"Use OAuth tokens issued via Okta for the service account\",\"isCorrect\":false},{\"id\":\"c\",\"text\":\"Create a dedicated user and enable key pair authentication for non-interactive login\",\"isCorrect\":true},{\"id\":\"d\",\"text\":\"Use a temporary, one-time password for each run via a script\",\"isCorrect\":false}]","explanation":"Correct answer: c. Rationale: Key pair authentication enables non-interactive logins suitable for automated ETL jobs and does not depend on interactive MFA flows. A is insecure because MFA is bypassed, and passwords may be exposed. B is viable but adds OAuth setup and token management complexity; for a simple, low-risk automation pattern, key pair is preferred. D is impractical and insecure since it reintroduces credentials management and is not supported by Snowflake as a standard practice for automation.","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["Snowflake","Key-Pair-Login","Okta","SAML-2.0","AWS","Terraform-Snowflake-Provider","certification-mcq","domain-weight-20"],"channel":"snowflake-core","subChannel":"account-access","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-11T22:20:43.455Z","createdAt":"2026-01-11 22:20:43"},{"id":"snowflake-core-account-access-1768170043454-1","question":"Which configuration best ensures admin actions in Snowflake are auditable and require MFA, while still enabling routine admin tasks?","answer":"[{\"id\":\"a\",\"text\":\"Enforce MFA for admin logins via the IdP and enable ACCOUNT_USAGE views (LOGIN_HISTORY, ACCESS_HISTORY) for auditing\",\"isCorrect\":true},{\"id\":\"b\",\"text\":\"Disable MFA for admins to simplify logins and rely on IP allowlists\",\"isCorrect\":false},{\"id\":\"c\",\"text\":\"Use a single global admin account with full privileges for all tasks\",\"isCorrect\":false},{\"id\":\"d\",\"text\":\"Disable auditing to avoid performance overhead\",\"isCorrect\":false}]","explanation":"Correct answer: a. Rationale: Enforcing MFA via the IdP ensures strong authentication for admin access, while ACCOUNT_USAGE (LOGIN_HISTORY, ACCESS_HISTORY) provides an auditable trail of admin actions. B weakens security by removing MFA. C concentrates power in one account increasing risk. D hides important activity data and is non-compliant.","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["Snowflake","MFA","Okta","SAML-2.0","AWS","Terraform-Snowflake-Provider","certification-mcq","domain-weight-20"],"channel":"snowflake-core","subChannel":"account-access","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-11T22:20:43.972Z","createdAt":"2026-01-11 22:20:44"},{"id":"snowflake-core-account-access-1768170043454-2","question":"To restrict access to Snowflake from a vendor network and ensure credentials rotate, which configuration provides the strongest, practical security posture?","answer":"[{\"id\":\"a\",\"text\":\"Create a NETWORK POLICY restricting access to the vendor IP and configure a SECURITY INTEGRATION with OAuth so tokens rotate and are short‑lived\",\"isCorrect\":true},{\"id\":\"b\",\"text\":\"Rely solely on a network policy with IP allowlisting and use a static long‑lived password for the vendor user\",\"isCorrect\":false},{\"id\":\"c\",\"text\":\" Blindly trust the vendor’s network and disable token rotation\",\"isCorrect\":false},{\"id\":\"d\",\"text\":\"Use a password rotation script without network controls\",\"isCorrect\":false}]","explanation":"Correct answer: a. Rationale: A NETWORK POLICY restricts access to a specific IP range, while a SECURITY INTEGRATION with OAuth provides short-lived tokens that rotate, reducing risk if credentials are compromised. B lacks dynamic token security and ignores network restrictions. C is unsafe and non-compliant.
