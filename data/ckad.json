{"questions":[{"id":"q-1066","question":"Inside namespace analytics, schedule a daily batch to process a CSV: use a CronJob (02:00 UTC) to start a Job that runs a Python script from a ConfigMap, reads input from a ConfigMap, uses a Secret for DB credentials to insert results into Postgres service, writes output to a PVC, runs as non-root with a readOnlyRootFilesystem, with resource limits, a backoffLimit of 3, and a 15-minute activeDeadlineSeconds; ensure proper probes?","answer":"Configure a CronJob in namespace analytics to launch a Job daily at 02:00 UTC. The Job runs a Python script sourced from a ConfigMap, reads input from another ConfigMap, uses a Secret for Postgres cre","explanation":"## Why This Is Asked\nThis problem tests advanced CKAD skills: combining CronJob and Job for batch work, wiring Script and data through ConfigMaps, securing credentials with Secrets, persisting output via PVCs, and enforcing pod security and lifecycle constraints. It also covers resource sizing, retries, timeouts, and basic health checks in a production-like scenario.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- CronJob, Job, PodSecurityContext\n- ConfigMap for scripts and input data\n- Secret for credentials\n- PersistentVolumeClaim for outputs\n- Probes, activeDeadlineSeconds, backoffLimit\n- runAsNonRoot, readOnlyRootFilesystem, resources\n\n## Code Example\n```yaml\napiVersion: batch/v1\nkind: CronJob\nmetadata:\n  name: daily-ingest\nspec:\n  schedule: '0 2 * * *'\n  jobTemplate:\n    spec:\n      template:\n        spec:\n          containers:\n          - name: ingest\n            image: myrepo/ingest:latest\n            volumeMounts:\n            - mountPath: /scripts\n              name: script\n          volumes:\n          - name: script\n            configMap:\n              name: ingest-scripts\n          restartPolicy: OnFailure\n```\n\n## Follow-up Questions\n- How would you test cron execution and idempotence?\n- How to rotate db credentials without redeploying the Job?","diagram":null,"difficulty":"advanced","tags":["ckad"],"channel":"ckad","subChannel":"general","sourceUrl":null,"videos":{"shortVideo":null,"longVideo":null},"companies":["Goldman Sachs","Microsoft","Snowflake"],"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-12T21:26:32.694Z","createdAt":"2026-01-12T21:26:32.694Z"},{"id":"q-858","question":"In a Kubernetes CKAD scenario, you have a Deployment named 'web-app' in namespace 'prod' with 3 replicas; pods frequently OOMKilled under load.
