{"questions":[{"id":"q-847","question":"You're deploying a CNF gateway (e.g., NGINX CNF) on a 50-node Kubernetes cluster handling streaming traffic. A node eviction hits during peak load. Outline a concrete plan to maintain streaming availability, focusing on (1) graceful drain with preStop, (2) health checks/readiness/liveness, and (3) traffic affinity and pod topology, and (4) observability and rollout strategy?","answer":"Use a Deployment of 4 replicas with PodDisruptionBudget minAvailable=3 and RollingUpdate maxUnavailable=25%.
