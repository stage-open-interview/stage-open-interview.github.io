Implement VPC Service Controls with perimeters around sensitive data services and configure access levels to require access from inside the perimeters. This design creates explicit data boundaries that prevent data exfiltration across the defined perimeters.\n\n## Why Other Options Are Wrong\n\n- B: Cloud Armor protects HTTP(S) frontends but does not govern data exfiltration from internal GCP services like Cloud Storage. \n- C: IAM alone cannot prevent data exfiltration across projects because members or service accounts can still access data from within perimeters if allowed. \n- D: Private Service Connect provides private access to Google services but does not by itself enforce cross-project data exfiltration controls across all data planes; VPC perimeters provide stronger, auditable boundaries.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n- VPC Service Controls\n- Service perimeters and access levels\n- Data exfiltration risk management\n- Cross-project data isolation\n\n## Real-World Application\n\nWhen operating a multi-tenant SaaS on GCP with strict residency requirements, wrap data stores (Cloud Storage, BigQuery) inside perimeters and enforce that all access comes from within these perimeters, ensuring exfiltration attempts are denied and auditable.","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["GCP","VPC Service Controls","Kubernetes","Terraform","AWS IAM","EKS","certification-mcq","domain-weight-18"],"channel":"gcp-cloud-architect","subChannel":"security-compliance","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-12T05:32:17.239Z","createdAt":"2026-01-12 05:32:17"},{"id":"gcp-cloud-architect-security-compliance-1768195937238-1","question":"An organization requires encryption at rest with strict control over encryption keys across Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and Spanner.
