You need to deploy a new OS image update with zero downtime and ensure upgrades are rolled across instances without taking all instances offline. Which VM scale set configuration best supports this requirement?","answer":"[{\"id\":\"a\",\"text\":\"Upgrade policy: Manual mode with manual upgrades\",\"isCorrect\":false},{\"id\":\"b\",\"text\":\"Upgrade policy: Automatic mode with rolling upgrades\",\"isCorrect\":true},{\"id\":\"c\",\"text\":\"Use an Availability Set to distribute instances\",\"isCorrect\":false},{\"id\":\"d\",\"text\":\"Deploy to a single zone without zone redundancy\",\"isCorrect\":false}]","explanation":"## Correct Answer\nOption B is correct. VM scale sets with upgradePolicy mode set to Automatic enable the platform to roll out updates gradually across instances, reducing downtime and preserving availability during image upgrades. \n\n## Why Other Options Are Wrong\n- Option A: Manual upgrades require explicit intervention and can lead to downtime if not carefully coordinated. \n- Option C: An Availability Set distributes across fault and update domains but does not provide built-in rolling upgrades for OS image changes. \n- Option D: A single-zone deployment eliminates zone redundancy and does not support safe rolling upgrades, increasing risk during maintenance. \n\n## Key Concepts\n- VM Scale Sets support upgradePolicy with mode Automatic or Manual \n- Rolling upgrades minimize downtime during OS image updates \n- Automatic upgrades coordinate across instances to maintain availability\n\n## Real-World Application\n- Use this pattern when you need to maintain high availability during OS updates across a fleet of VMs behind a load balancer.","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["Azure","VMSS","AZ-104","Terraform","Kubernetes","AWS","certification-mcq","domain-weight-20"],"channel":"azure-administrator","subChannel":"deploy-manage-compute","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-12T06:36:27.881Z","createdAt":"2026-01-12 06:36:28"},{"id":"azure-administrator-deploy-manage-compute-1768199787880-1","question":"You need to automate post-provision configuration on each VM instance in a VM scale set, such as installing agents and applying a baseline configuration.

The Custom Script Extension runs a script on each VM in the scale set after provisioning to install software or apply configuration. \n\n## Why Other Options Are Wrong\n- Option B: Microsoft Monitoring Agent collects telemetry, not intended for post-provision configuration. \n- Option C: VM Access Extension provides remote access, not mass configuration. \n- Option D: DSC Extension can enforce configuration state but is more complex; the question asks for a script-based post-provision run, which the Custom Script Extension is designed for. \n\n## Key Concepts\n- Custom Script Extension enables agentless, script-based provisioning across VMSS\n- Extensions are the primary mechanism for post-provision configuration on Azure VMs\n\n## Real-World Application\n- Use this for rapid baseline setup across all instances (e.g., install monitoring, agents, and initial configuration) after VMSS provisioning.","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["Azure","VMSS","AZ-104","Terraform","Kubernetes","AWS","certification-mcq","domain-weight-20"],"channel":"azure-administrator","subChannel":"deploy-manage-compute","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-12T06:36:28.401Z","createdAt":"2026-01-12 06:36:28"},{"id":"azure-administrator-deploy-manage-compute-1768199787880-2","question":"To protect a VM-based backend against data-center (zone) outages in a region that supports Availability Zones, which deployment option should you choose?","answer":"[{\"id\":\"a\",\"text\":\"Deploy a single VM in one zone behind an internal load balancer\",\"isCorrect\":false},{\"id\":\"b\",\"text\":\"Use an Availability Set to distribute across fault and update domains\",\"isCorrect\":false},{\"id\":\"c\",\"text\":\"Use a VM Scale Set configured for zone-redundant deployment (Availability Zones)\",\"isCorrect\":true},{\"id\":\"d\",\"text\":\"Deploy to App Service with regional replication\",\"isCorrect\":false}]","explanation":"## Correct Answer\nOption C is correct.
