Enabling bucket versioning adds protection against accidental overwrites, and S3 Object Lock can enforce retention to prevent tampering or deletion, giving robust long-term integrity for investigations.\n\n## Why Other Options Are Wrong\n- B: Disabling log file validation removes cryptographic assurance of log integrity; data events alone do not guarantee tamper evidence.\n- C: A single bucket in the master account without versioning exposes logs to overwrites and loss of historical integrity across accounts.\n- D: Encrypting CloudWatch Logs protects data at rest but does not provide tamper evidence or cross-account integrity guarantees for CloudTrail logs.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- CloudTrail log file validation\n- Organization trails for multi-account coverage\n- S3 versioning and Object Lock for retention and immutability\n- Centralized logging architecture\n\n## Real-World Application\nEnsures defensible, auditable logs across an organization for incident response and forensics, even if some accounts are compromised.","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["AWS CloudTrail","AWS Organizations","Amazon S3","S3 Object Lock","certification-mcq","domain-weight-18"],"channel":"aws-security-specialty","subChannel":"security-logging","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-12T03:48:11.876Z","createdAt":"2026-01-12 03:48:11"},{"id":"aws-security-specialty-security-logging-1768282143844-0","question":"An enterprise has CloudTrail enabled in all regions, VPC Flow Logs, and GuardDuty.
