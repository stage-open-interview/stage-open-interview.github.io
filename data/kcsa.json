{"questions":[{"id":"q-836","question":"You are analyzing a web app's login events, captured as an array of objects: { userId: string, ts: string (ISO 8601) }. Write a JavaScript function that returns the top 3 users by login count in the past 24 hours. Tie-break with alphabetical userId. Provide a concise implementation and explain its time complexity?","answer":"Use a rolling 24h window: parse ts to ms, keep per-user counts in a Map, filter to now - t <= 24h, sort by count desc then userId asc, return top 3. Time complexity O(n log m) where m is distinct user","explanation":"## Why This Is Asked\nTests practical data processing in JavaScript: time-window filtering, per-user aggregation, and deterministic tie-breaking.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Time-window filtering\n- Hash map for counts\n- Stable sorting with tie-breakers\n- Input validation and edge cases\n\n## Code Example\n\n```javascript\nfunction topUsers(events) {\n  const now = Date.now();\n  const window = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;\n  const counts = new Map();\n  for (const e of events) {\n    const t = Date.parse(e.ts);\n    if (Number.isNaN(t)) continue;\n    if (now - t <= window) {\n      counts.set(e.userId, (counts.get(e.userId) || 0) + 1);\n    }\n  }\n  const arr = Array.from(counts.entries());\n  arr.sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1] || a[0].localeCompare(b[0]));\n  return arr.slice(0, 3).map(([id]) => id);\n}\n```\n\n## Follow-up Questions\n- How would you adapt this for streaming data?\n- How would you test with synthetic data to cover edge cases?","diagram":"flowchart TD\n  A[Events] --> B{Filter 24h}\n  B --> C[Count per User]\n  C --> D[Sort by Count, then ID]\n  D --> E[Top 3 Results]","difficulty":"beginner","tags":["kcsa"],"channel":"kcsa","subChannel":"general","sourceUrl":null,"videos":{"shortVideo":null,"longVideo":null},"companies":["Meta","NVIDIA"],"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-12T13:21:30.077Z","createdAt":"2026-01-12T13:21:30.077Z"}],"subChannels":["general"],"companies":["Meta","NVIDIA"],"stats":{"total":1,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"newThisWeek":1}}
