It uses a dedicated service account for the workload and grants only the exact permissions required (read access to the bucket and publish rights to Pub/Sub), enabling tight least-privilege control and avoiding long-lived credentials. Workload Identity provides secure, rotation-friendly access without keys.\n\n## Why Other Options Are Wrong\n- A: Grants broad access to a single service account; increases blast radius and reduces isolation between workloads.\n- C: Stores credentials, introducing key rotation and secret management overhead; risks leakage.\n- D: Grants overly broad permissions (owner/editor) beyond what's needed.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Principle of least privilege\n- Workload Identity and service accounts\n- Avoiding long-lived credentials\n\n## Real-World Application\n- This pattern is common when deploying microservices on Cloud Run that interact with multiple resources, ensuring each workload has just what it needs and no more.\n","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["GCP","IAM","Workload Identity","Pub/Sub","Cloud Storage","Terraform","Kubernetes","certification-mcq","domain-weight-27"],"channel":"gcp-security-engineer","subChannel":"access-management","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-11T19:18:17.524Z","createdAt":"2026-01-11 19:18:17"},{"id":"gcp-security-engineer-access-management-1768159097523-1","question":"An organization uses VPC Service Controls perimeters to prevent data exfiltration.

The appropriate approach is to configure an Access Level that includes the partner IP range and apply it to the perimeter, allowing restricted access from the partner while maintaining data exfiltration protections. This preserves the perimeter's security posture and avoids exposing the bucket outside the perimeter.\n\n## Why Other Options Are Wrong\n- B: Weakens security by removing perimeter protections during maintenance.\n- C: Shifts risk outside the perimeter instead of staying protected.\n- D: Public access defeats perimeters and exposes data.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- VPC Service Controls perimeters\n- Access Levels and IP-based allowlisting\n- Data exfiltration prevention\n\n## Real-World Application\n- Common when you need temporary, controlled access for third parties without weakening security boundaries.\n","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["GCP","VPC Service Controls","Access Context Manager","Perimeters","Kubernetes","Terraform","certification-mcq","domain-weight-27"],"channel":"gcp-security-engineer","subChannel":"access-management","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-11T19:18:18.016Z","createdAt":"2026-01-11 19:18:18"},{"id":"gcp-security-engineer-access-management-1768159097523-2","question":"To grant a contractor access to a BigQuery dataset for a limited two-week window, and require MFA for access, which configuration best achieves this using IAM Conditions?","answer":"[{\"id\":\"a\",\"text\":\"Create an IAM binding on the dataset with a condition that enforces the time window and MFA via request.auth.claims.mfa.\",\"isCorrect\":true},{\"id\":\"b\",\"text\":\"Create a separate project and move the dataset there, with no conditional policy.\",\"isCorrect\":false},{\"id\":\"c\",\"text\":\"Grant the contractor a long-lived service account key to access the dataset.\",\"isCorrect\":false},{\"id\":\"d\",\"text\":\"Use public access with a password-protected bucket to approximate control.\",\"isCorrect\":false}]","explanation":"## Correct Answer\nA. IAM Conditions support time-bound constraints and token claims (such as MFA).
