Cloud Build handles the CI portion (build, test, and scan) while Cloud Deploy handles the CD flow.\n\n## Why Other Options Are Wrong\n\n- A describes manual traffic shifts instead of a governed canary flow; lacks auditable deployment policy.\n- C uses a non-GCP-native tool (Jenkins) which adds management overhead and does not leverage Cloud Deploy's canary capabilities.\n- D Cloud Run cannot orchestrate a multi-stage, progressive delivery pipeline by itself.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n- Progressive delivery with Cloud Deploy\n- Canary releases and traffic splitting\n- CI/CD integration with Cloud Build\n\n## Real-World Application\n\n- Create a Cloud Build trigger to build and push images to Artifact Registry\n- Define a Cloud Deploy delivery pipeline for the Cloud Run service with canary stages (e.g., 10% -> 50%) and automated promotions/rollbacks\n- Monitor health and metrics to trigger automatic promotions or rollbacks","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["GCP","CloudBuild","CloudDeploy","CloudRun","CI/CD","Kubernetes","certification-mcq","domain-weight-23"],"channel":"gcp-devops-engineer","subChannel":"build-delivery","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-11T19:17:19.159Z","createdAt":"2026-01-11 19:17:19"},{"id":"gcp-devops-engineer-build-delivery-1768159039158-1","question":"You want to securely manage credentials used by Cloud Build steps.
