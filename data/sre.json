SLIs are the raw data points or metrics used to assess performance against Service Level Objectives (SLOs). They are crucial for objectively understanding how a service is performing from a user's perspective.\n\n**Key Characteristics of an SLI:**\n1.  **Quantitative Measure:** A specific, numerical value derived from system telemetry.\n2.  **User-Centric:** Reflects an aspect of service performance that directly impacts user experience.\n3.  **Directly Measurable:** Can be obtained from monitoring systems, logs, or other data sources.\n4.  **Good Proxy for User Happiness:** A change in the SLI should correlate with a change in user satisfaction.\n5.  **Reliably Measured:** The measurement itself should be accurate and dependable.\n\n**Common Types of SLIs:**\n*   **Availability:** Measures the proportion of time the service is usable or the percentage of successful requests.\n*   *Example:* (Number of successful HTTP requests / Total valid HTTP requests) * 100%.\n*   **Latency:** Measures the time taken to serve a request. Often measured at specific percentiles (e.g., 95th, 99th percentile) to understand typical and worst-case performance.\n*   *Example:* The 99th percentile of API response times for the `/users` endpoint over the last 5 minutes.\n*   **Error Rate:** Measures the proportion of requests that result in errors.\n*   *Example:* (Number of HTTP 5xx responses / Total valid HTTP requests) * 100%.\n*   **Throughput:** Measures the rate at which the system processes requests or data.\n*   *Example:* Requests per second (RPS) handled by the shopping cart service.\n*   **Durability:** Measures the likelihood that data stored in the system will be retained over a long period without corruption.\n*   *Example:* Probability of a stored object remaining intact and accessible after one year.\n*   **Correctness/Quality:** Measures if the service provides the right answer or performs the right action.\n*   *Example:* Percentage of search queries that return relevant results, or proportion of financial transactions processed without data errors.\n\n**How to Choose Good SLIs:**\n1.  **Focus on User Experience:** What aspects of performance or reliability are most important to your users?\n2.  **Keep it Simple:** Choose a small number of meaningful SLIs rather than trying to track everything.\n3.  **Ensure it's Actionable:** The SLI should provide data that can lead to improvements or inform decisions.\n4.  **Distinguish from Raw Metrics:** While SLIs are derived from metrics, they are specifically chosen and often processed (e.g., aggregated, percentiled) to represent service level.\n\n**Relationship with SLOs and SLAs:**\n*   SLIs are the **measurements**.\n*   SLOs are the **targets** for those measurements (e.g., SLI for availability >= 99.9%).\n*   SLAs are the **agreements** with users, often based on achieving certain SLOs, and typically include consequences if not met.\n\n**Example:**\n*   **User Journey:** User uploads a photo.\n*   **Possible SLIs:**\n*   `upload_success_rate`: (Number of successful photo uploads / Total photo upload attempts) * 100%\n*   `upload_latency_p95`: 95th percentile of time taken from initiating upload to confirmation.\n*   **Corresponding SLO for `upload_success_rate` might be:** 99.9% over a 7-day window.","diagram":"flowchart TD\n  A[User Request] --> B[Service Level Indicator SLI]\n  B --> C[Quantitative Measurement]\n  C --> D[Raw Data Points]\n  D --> E[Service Quality Metrics]\n  E --> F[Performance Monitoring]\n  F --> G[Service Level Objectives SLO]\n  G --> H[Service Level Agreements SLA]\n  H --> I[Cloud Service Provider]","difficulty":"advanced","tags":["advanced","cloud"],"channel":"sre","subChannel":"observability","sourceUrl":null,"videos":{"longVideo":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3ReKuJ8ewA"},"companies":["Amazon","Citadel","Goldman Sachs","Google","Microsoft"],"eli5":"Imagine you have a lemonade stand.
