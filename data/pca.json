{"questions":[{"id":"q-837","question":"In a dataset with 120k samples and 200 features, after standardizing, you fit PCA and observe 95% variance explained by the first 8 components. How would you validate using PCA for downstream linear regression, decide the number of components, and interpret the top loadings? Consider missing values and large-scale data in your answer?","answer":"Use explained variance, scree, and cross-validated reconstruction error to pick k; for large data, use IncrementalPCA and scale features. Validate by nested CV: train a linear regressor on the k compo","explanation":"## Why This Is Asked\nAssesses practical PCA decision-making, including selection of components, preprocessing, and how to validate in a regression context.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Explained variance and scree plots\n- Cross-validated reconstruction error\n- Incremental PCA for scale\n- Loadings interpretation and mapping to features\n- Handling missing data in PCA\n\n## Code Example\n```python\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import IncrementalPCA\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\n# pipeline sketch\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\npipe = Pipeline([\n  ('scaler', StandardScaler()),\n  ('ipca', IncrementalPCA(n_components=8)),\n  ('lr', LinearRegression())\n])\n# fit and evaluate with cross-validation\n```\n\n## Follow-up Questions\n- How would you handle categorical features with PCA?\n- What trade-offs arise with Sparse PCA vs dense components?","diagram":"flowchart TD\n  A[Standardize data] --> B[PCA fit]\n  B --> C[Select k by explained variance]\n  C --> D[Nested CV with regressor on k components]\n  D --> E[Compare to full-feature model]\n  E --> F[Interpret top loadings]","difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["pca"],"channel":"pca","subChannel":"general","sourceUrl":null,"videos":{"shortVideo":null,"longVideo":null},"companies":["Amazon","Google","Plaid"],"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-12T13:21:56.218Z","createdAt":"2026-01-12T13:21:56.218Z"}],"subChannels":["general"],"companies":["Amazon","Google","Plaid"],"stats":{"total":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":1,"advanced":0,"newThisWeek":1}}
