Azure Traffic Manager is DNS-based and does not perform real-time health-based routing at the HTTP layer; Azure Application Gateway is regional and handles traffic within a single region; while Azure CDN optimizes delivery of static content, it does not provide global dynamic routing for multi-region web apps.\n\n## Why Other Options Are Wrong\n- Azure Traffic Manager relies on DNS-based routing and lacks real-time health-based failover at the HTTP layer.\n- Azure CDN focuses on content delivery acceleration rather than global dynamic routing for web app endpoints.\n- Azure Application Gateway operates within a single region and does not provide global cross-region traffic management.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Global routing with Front Door\n- Health checks and regional failover\n- Layer-7 routing vs DNS-based routing\n- Edge delivery for web apps\n\n## Real-World Application\nUse Front Door as the global entry point for a multi-region web app to minimize latency and ensure regional failover during outages.","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["Azure","AWS","Kubernetes","Terraform","AzureFrontDoor","AKS","certification-mcq","domain-weight-35"],"channel":"azure-fundamentals","subChannel":"azure-architecture","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-11T20:20:39.328Z","createdAt":"2026-01-11 20:20:39"},{"id":"azure-fundamentals-azure-architecture-1768162839324-1","question":"An organization needs long-term retention for large historical documents with strict immutability and minimal access over many years.

The Hot tier is costlier for long-term retention; Data Lake Storage Gen2 in Cool tier does not inherently enforce immutability for compliance; Managed Disks with snapshots are not suited for unstructured historical documents at scale.\n\n## Why Other Options Are Wrong\n- Hot tier is best for frequently accessed data and would incur higher costs for long-term retention.\n- Data Lake Storage Gen2 in Cool tier does not provide built-in immutability retention policies needed for compliance.\n- Managed Disks with snapshots are designed for VM disks, not for long-term immutable archival storage of unstructured documents.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Blob storage tiers (Hot, Cool, Archive)\n- Immutability policies and legal holds\n- Compliance retention in Azure Storage\n- Cost optimization for archival data\n\n## Real-World Application\nThis configuration is ideal for archival compliance in regulated industries (e.g., legal docs, financial records) where data must be retained unaltered for many years at minimal cost.","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["Azure","Terraform","AWS","Kubernetes","AzureBlobArchive","certification-mcq","domain-weight-35"],"channel":"azure-fundamentals","subChannel":"azure-architecture","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-11T20:20:39.874Z","createdAt":"2026-01-11 20:20:40"},{"id":"azure-fundamentals-azure-architecture-1768162839324-2","question":"An AKS cluster hosts a microservices-based application.
