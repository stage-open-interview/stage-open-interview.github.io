{"questions":[{"id":"q-673","question":"You manage a small SAP NetWeaver footprint on AWS using EC2 for the app tier and a separate DB tier on HANA. Describe a practical single-region HA and backup plan to meet an RPO of 15 minutes and an RTO of 60 minutes. Include chosen services, EC2 sizing approach, storage strategy (EBS/S3), backup schedule, and a cost-conscious trade-off you’d consider?","answer":"I would design a two-AZ SAP NetWeaver stack with a synchronous HANA replication primary/standby, app tier in an Auto Scaling group behind a load balancer, and daily full backups with 15-minute log bac","explanation":"## Why This Is Asked\nTests practical HA/backup planning for SAP on AWS, balancing RPO/RTO within a single region while considering cost.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- SAP on AWS HA patterns: cross-AZ, synchronous replication, application DB separation\n- Storage: EBS for volumes, S3 for backups, lifecycle policies\n- Automation: CloudFormation/Infra as code, CloudWatch alarms, Route 53 health checks\n- Cost trade-offs: standby sizing vs on-demand spin-up, reserved instances, spot usage\n\n## Code Example\n```yaml\n# Minimal CloudFormation skeleton for SAP web tier ASG with EBS-backed volumes\nResources:\n  SAPWebASG:\n    Type: AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup\n    Properties:\n      MinSize: 2\n      MaxSize: 4\n      LaunchConfigurationName: !Ref SAPLaunchCfg\n```\n\n## Follow-up Questions\n- How often would you test DR and what metrics matter?\n- What changes for cross-region DR would you consider?","diagram":"flowchart TD\n  A[Request] --> B[Define SAP workload]\n  B --> C[Select EC2 sizing & storage]\n  C --> D[Plan HA/DR within region]\n  D --> E[Automate with IaC]\n  E --> F[Monitoring & backup]","difficulty":"beginner","tags":["aws-sap"],"channel":"aws-sap","subChannel":"general","sourceUrl":null,"videos":{"shortVideo":null,"longVideo":null},"companies":["Microsoft","Robinhood"],"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-11T14:45:06.666Z","createdAt":"2026-01-11T14:45:06.670Z"}],"subChannels":["general"],"companies":["Microsoft","Robinhood"],"stats":{"total":1,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"newThisWeek":1}}
