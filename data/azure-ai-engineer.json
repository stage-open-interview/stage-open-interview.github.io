How would you design a lightweight API boundary policy (Azure API Management) to rate-limit per user, cap monthly spend, and gracefully fall back to a rule-based reply if OpenAI is unavailable? Describe the data flow from API call through OpenAI or fallback, and include a minimal policy snippet?","answer":"Leverage APIM quotas and per-user throttling, with a backend spend check stored in a fast store. Forward within quota to OpenAI; on quota exceed or OpenAI failure, return a canned rule-based reply and","explanation":"## Why This Is Asked\nDemonstrates practical API boundary design, basic rate limiting, and graceful degradation in a beginner-friendly Azure setup.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- API Management quotas and rate limits by user\n- Per-user spend cap and simple state store\n- Fallback to rule-based replies on failure\n- Observability for quotas and failures\n\n## Code Example\n```javascript\n// Minimal mock of request flow with quota check and fallback\nasync function handle(req) {\n  const user = req.userId;\n  const quota = getUserQuota(user);\n  if (quota.remaining <= 0) return cannedReply();\n  try {\n    const res = await callOpenAI(req.payload);\n    debitQuota(user, req.payload.length);\n    return res;\n  } catch {\n    return cannedReply();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Follow-up Questions\n- How would you test quota expiry and fallback paths?\n- How would you simulate OpenAI downtime in a local test environment?","diagram":"flowchart TD\n  Client[Client Request] --> APIM[APIM Policy: Rate/Quota]\n  APIM --> OpenAI[OpenAI Call]\n  OpenAI --> APIM[OpenAI Response]\n  APIM --> Client[Client Response]","difficulty":"beginner","tags":["azure-ai-engineer"],"channel":"azure-ai-engineer","subChannel":"general","sourceUrl":null,"videos":{"shortVideo":null,"longVideo":null},"companies":["Apple","Bloomberg","Square"],"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":true,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-12T17:25:17.050Z","createdAt":"2026-01-12T17:25:17.050Z"}],"subChannels":["general"],"companies":["Airbnb","Amazon","Anthropic","Apple","Bloomberg","Citadel","Cloudflare","Coinbase","Databricks","DoorDash","Google","Hashicorp","Instacart","Meta","Microsoft","MongoDB","NVIDIA","PayPal","Scale Ai","Snowflake","Square","Tesla","Twitter","Two Sigma","Uber"],"stats":{"total":14,"beginner":5,"intermediate":5,"advanced":4,"newThisWeek":14}}
