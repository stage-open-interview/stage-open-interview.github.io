{"questions":[{"id":"aws-networking-specialty-network-design-1768148708669-0","question":"You are designing a network for two AWS regions hosting six VPCs across multiple accounts. The company must ensure centralized egress to on-premises network via VPN, minimize inter-VPC data transfer costs, and support scalable inter-region connectivity for future growth. Which design best meets these requirements?","answer":"[{\"id\":\"a\",\"text\":\"Create a full mesh of VPC peering between all VPCs with a single VPN from one VPC to on-premises, and enable route propagation across peers\",\"isCorrect\":false},{\"id\":\"b\",\"text\":\"Deploy a regional AWS Transit Gateway in each region, attach each VPC to its regional TGW, enable inter-region TGW peering, and attach the on-prem VPN to the TGW\",\"isCorrect\":true},{\"id\":\"c\",\"text\":\"Create a separate VPN connection from each VPC directly to the on-premises network, with no central hub\",\"isCorrect\":false},{\"id\":\"d\",\"text\":\"Use AWS Cloud WAN to interconnect all VPCs and on-premises via a single global network fabric\",\"isCorrect\":false}]","explanation":"## Correct Answer\nThe regional Transit Gateway (TGW) hub-and-spoke model with inter-region TGW peering is the scalable, cost-conscious pattern for multi-region setups. It minimizes inter-VPC data transfer costs by avoiding deep mesh peering and provides a centralized path to on-prem via VPN attachments on the TGWs.\n\n## Why Other Options Are Wrong\n- Option A: Full mesh VPC peering becomes unmanageable as the number of VPCs grows and does not support scalable centralized egress or transitive routing between VPCs.\n- Option C: Direct per-VPC VPN connections to on-prem create many connections, management overhead, and failover complexity, and do not scale well.\n- Option D: Cloud WAN is newer and less commonly adopted in exam scenarios; it may introduce additional constraints and is not needed when TGW-based hub and spoke already satisfies requirements.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- AWS Transit Gateway (regional) as hub for VPC attachments\n- Inter-region Transit Gateway peering for cross-region connectivity\n- VPN attachments to Transit Gateway for centralized on-prem connectivity\n\n## Real-World Application\n- Large enterprises with multi-account, multi-region deployments can converge to a TGW hub model, enabling scalable connectivity, centralized policy enforcement, and easier audit/compliance across regions.","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["AWS","TransitGateway","VPC","Inter-region","NetworkDesign","certification-mcq","domain-weight-30"],"channel":"aws-networking-specialty","subChannel":"network-design","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-11T16:25:08.670Z","createdAt":"2026-01-11 16:25:08"},{"id":"aws-networking-specialty-network-design-1768148708669-1","question":"You have a VPC with private subnets across three AZs that requires outbound internet access for software updates. To minimize NAT-related costs while preserving high availability, which design provides the best balance?","answer":"[{\"id\":\"a\",\"text\":\"Deploy a NAT Gateway in each AZ and route the private subnets in the corresponding AZ to the NAT Gateway in that AZ\",\"isCorrect\":true},{\"id\":\"b\",\"text\":\"Deploy a single NAT Gateway in one AZ and route all private subnets in every AZ to that single NAT Gateway\",\"isCorrect\":false},{\"id\":\"c\",\"text\":\"Use NAT Instances in a single AZ and rely on cross-AZ routing to other private subnets to reach the NAT instance\",\"isCorrect\":false},{\"id\":\"d\",\"text\":\"Remove NAT and place all outbound resources in public subnets with public IPs\",\"isCorrect\":false}]","explanation":"## Correct Answer\nDeploy a NAT Gateway in each AZ and route private subnets in the same AZ to the NAT Gateway in that AZ. This pattern provides high availability across AZ failures and avoids cross-AZ routing constraints, while NAT Gateway offers managed scaling and maintenance.\n\n## Why Other Options Are Wrong\n- Option B: A single NAT Gateway in one AZ cannot serve private subnets in other AZs reliably; cross-AZ routing to the NAT Gateway is not supported.\n- Option C: NAT Instances can be cheaper but require ongoing maintenance, patching, and manual scaling; not as reliable or scalable as NAT Gateway for multi-AZ HA.\n- Option D: Public subnets sacrifice the security isolation of private subnets and increase exposure to the internet.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- NAT Gateway per AZ for HA\n- Private subnets route to local AZ NAT\n- Managed NAT vs manual NAT instances\n\n## Real-World Application\n- Ensures updates and patching from private subnets without exposing resources to the internet, while remaining resilient to AZ failures.","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["AWS","NATGateway","VPC","HA","Networking","certification-mcq","domain-weight-30"],"channel":"aws-networking-specialty","subChannel":"network-design","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-11T16:25:09.057Z","createdAt":"2026-01-11 16:25:09"},{"id":"aws-networking-specialty-network-design-1768148708669-2","question":"In a multi-account AWS environment with Dev and Prod VPCs, you want to route inter-account traffic through a centralized security inspection VPC located in a shared services account.

This avoids the complexity and scalability issues of direct VPC peering between many accounts and enables centralized inspection.\n\n## Why Other Options Are Wrong\n- Option A: Direct VPC peering between Dev and Prod is non-transitive and becomes unwieldy as the number of accounts grows; it also distributes security policy enforcement rather than centralizing it.\n- Option C: VPNs between VPCs require multiple VPN connections and management; they do not provide a scalable central inspection point.\n- Option D: Direct internet exposure bypasses the internal security controls and defeats segmentation.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- AWS Transit Gateway as a scalable hub for multi-account networks\n- Centralized security inspection in a shared services VPC\n- Least privilege and centralized policy enforcement across accounts\n\n## Real-World Application\n- Large organizations use a centralized security stack behind a Transit Gateway to enforce uniform security controls across many teams and environments.","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["AWS","TransitGateway","VPC","Security","MultiAccount","certification-mcq","domain-weight-30"],"channel":"aws-networking-specialty","subChannel":"network-design","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-11T16:25:09.402Z","createdAt":"2026-01-11 16:25:09"}],"subChannels":["network-design"],"companies":[],"stats":{"total":3,"beginner":0,"intermediate":3,"advanced":0,"newThisWeek":3}}
