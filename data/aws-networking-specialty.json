This provides application-layer protection and blocks common attack patterns before traffic reaches EC2 instances. The other options are incorrect: A misuses IAM policies on the load balancer for traffic filtering; B relies only on security groups, which cannot inspect HTTP payloads and are not designed for edge-layer filtering; D CloudTrail is an audit log service and does not block traffic in real time.\n\n## Why Other Options Are Wrong\n- Option A: IAM policies do not filter network traffic at the edge.\n- Option B: Security Groups are stateful and operate at the instance level, not edge filtering for web exploits.\n- Option D: CloudTrail records events, not enforce traffic filtering.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- AWS WAF provides edge-layer filtering of HTTP/S traffic.\n- ALB integration allows applying rules before traffic hits targets.\n\n## Real-World Application\n- Use WAF rules to block SQLi,
