The company must ensure centralized egress to on-premises network via VPN, minimize inter-VPC data transfer costs, and support scalable inter-region connectivity for future growth.

It minimizes inter-VPC data transfer costs by avoiding deep mesh peering and provides a centralized path to on-prem via VPN attachments on the TGWs.\n\n## Why Other Options Are Wrong\n- Option A: Full mesh VPC peering becomes unmanageable as the number of VPCs grows and does not support scalable centralized egress or transitive routing between VPCs.\n- Option C: Direct per-VPC VPN connections to on-prem create many connections, management overhead, and failover complexity, and do not scale well.\n- Option D: Cloud WAN is newer and less commonly adopted in exam scenarios; it may introduce additional constraints and is not needed when TGW-based hub and spoke already satisfies requirements.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- AWS Transit Gateway (regional) as hub for VPC attachments\n- Inter-region Transit Gateway peering for cross-region connectivity\n- VPN attachments to Transit Gateway for centralized on-prem connectivity\n\n## Real-World Application\n- Large enterprises with multi-account, multi-region deployments can converge to a TGW hub model, enabling scalable connectivity, centralized policy enforcement, and easier audit/compliance across regions.","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["AWS","TransitGateway","VPC","Inter-region","NetworkDesign","certification-mcq","domain-weight-30"],"channel":"aws-networking-specialty","subChannel":"network-design","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-11T16:25:08.670Z","createdAt":"2026-01-11 16:25:08"},{"id":"aws-networking-specialty-network-design-1768148708669-1","question":"You have a VPC with private subnets across three AZs that requires outbound internet access for software updates.

This pattern provides high availability across AZ failures and avoids cross-AZ routing constraints, while NAT Gateway offers managed scaling and maintenance.\n\n## Why Other Options Are Wrong\n- Option B: A single NAT Gateway in one AZ cannot serve private subnets in other AZs reliably; cross-AZ routing to the NAT Gateway is not supported.\n- Option C: NAT Instances can be cheaper but require ongoing maintenance, patching, and manual scaling; not as reliable or scalable as NAT Gateway for multi-AZ HA.\n- Option D: Public subnets sacrifice the security isolation of private subnets and increase exposure to the internet.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- NAT Gateway per AZ for HA\n- Private subnets route to local AZ NAT\n- Managed NAT vs manual NAT instances\n\n## Real-World Application\n- Ensures updates and patching from private subnets without exposing resources to the internet, while remaining resilient to AZ failures.","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["AWS","NATGateway","VPC","HA","Networking","certification-mcq","domain-weight-30"],"channel":"aws-networking-specialty","subChannel":"network-design","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-11T16:25:09.057Z","createdAt":"2026-01-11 16:25:09"},{"id":"aws-networking-specialty-network-design-1768148708669-2","question":"In a multi-account AWS environment with Dev and Prod VPCs, you want to route inter-account traffic through a centralized security inspection VPC located in a shared services account.
