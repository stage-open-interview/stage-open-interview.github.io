{"questions":[{"id":"q-672","question":"Design a scalable, cost-aware data ingestion and processing pipeline on AWS for 1 TB/day of log data arriving from multiple on-prem and cloud sources. The pipeline must deliver raw data immutably for 90 days, provide near-real-time enrichment within 5 seconds, and support cross-region failover. Specify services, data flows, constraints, and trade-offs?","answer":"Use per-region Kinesis Data Firehose to S3 with Object Lock for immutability, enable SSE-KMS, and enable lifecycle for cost. Run Glue Streaming for enrichment, and DynamoDB to store offsets/state. DLQ","explanation":"## Why This Is Asked\nAssesses design of scalable, compliant pipelines with immutability, latency, DR, and cost in AWS.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- Kinesis Firehose, S3, Object Lock, SSE-KMS\n- Glue Streaming, Lambda, DynamoDB state\n- DLQ, cross-region replication, CloudWatch\n\n## Code Example\n```javascript\n// Pseudo-idempotent Lambda sketch\nconst AWS = require('aws-sdk');\nconst ddb = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();\nexports.handler = async (evt) => {\n  const key = { id: evt.id };\n  const exists = await ddb.get({TableName:'Processed', Key:key}).promise();\n  if (exists.Item) return;\n  await ddb.put({TableName:'Processed', Item:{id: evt.id, t: Date.now()}}).promise();\n  // enrich data\n};\n```\n\n## Follow-up Questions\n- How would you validate data quality and schema evolution across regions?\n- How do you handle late-arriving data and reprocessing without duplicating work?","diagram":"flowchart TD\n  A[Ingest] --> B[Kinesis Firehose]\n  B --> C[S3 regional bucket]\n  C --> D[Object Lock: immutability]\n  D --> E[Glue Streaming / Lambda]\n  E --> F[DynamoDB state]\n  F --> G[CloudWatch alarms]","difficulty":"advanced","tags":["aws-saa"],"channel":"aws-saa","subChannel":"general","sourceUrl":null,"videos":{"shortVideo":null,"longVideo":null},"companies":["Hashicorp","IBM"],"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-11T14:44:21.525Z","createdAt":"2026-01-11T14:44:21.525Z"}],"subChannels":["general"],"companies":["Hashicorp","IBM"],"stats":{"total":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"newThisWeek":1}}
