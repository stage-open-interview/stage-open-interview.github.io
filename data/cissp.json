{"questions":[{"id":"cissp-communication-network-1768227886993-3","question":"An organization wants to ensure the integrity and authenticity of DNS responses to prevent cache poisoning, while not necessarily encrypting DNS query payloads. Which mechanism provides this guarantee?","answer":"DNSSEC validation provides integrity and authenticity guarantees for DNS responses through digital signatures, preventing cache poisoning attacks without encrypting the query payloads.","explanation":"## Correct Answer\nA. DNSSEC validation.\n\n## Why Other Options Are Wrong\n- B: DNS over TLS encrypts query payloads, providing confidentiality, not just integrity.\n- C: DNS over HTTPS also provides confidentiality.\n- D: Rate limiting DNS tunneling does not inherently provide integrity/authentication for DNS responses.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- DNSSEC, data integrity, origin authentication\n\n## Real-World Application\n- Enabling DNSSEC validation at resolvers helps prevent cache poisoning and man-in-the-middle manipulation of DNS responses.","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["AWS","DNS","Terraform","certification-mcq","domain-weight-13"],"channel":"cissp","subChannel":"communication-network","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":true,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-13T03:32:48.470Z","createdAt":"2026-01-12 14:24:48"},{"id":"q-1097","question":"An enterprise with microservices deployed across AWS, Azure, and GCP stores API keys and credentials in Kubernetes secrets and environment variables. After an audit finds stale keys and overly broad service accounts, design a defense‑in‑depth credential management strategy: architecture changes, tooling choices (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, KMS, Kubernetes CSI or equivalent), rotation cadence, access controls, and how you would validate effectiveness?","answer":"Centralize secrets in a unified vault (Vault or cloud secret managers) with per-service principals and short-lived credentials.
