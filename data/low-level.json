{"questions":[{"id":"q-684","question":"Design a fixed-size ring buffer in C that stores bytes. Capacity N is a power of two (e.g., 1024). Show how to compute the next index using a mask (idx & (N-1)), and explain full vs empty detection using only head and tail counters. Provide enqueue and dequeue logic for a single-producer/single-consumer scenario?","answer":"Use two indices: head and tail. Let mask = N-1. Enqueue: if ((head - tail) == N) return 0; data[head & mask] = value; head++; Dequeue: if (head == tail) return 0; *out = data[tail & mask]; tail++; Thi","explanation":"## Why This Is Asked\n\nTests understanding of a practical, low-level data structure and its wrap-around behavior, plus efficient empty/full checks in a simple producer/consumer path.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n- Ring buffers\n- Power-of-two masking\n- Empty/full checks with head/tail without extra state\n- SPSC memory ordering\n\n## Code Example\n\n```c\ntypedef struct {\n  size_t head, tail;\n  unsigned char data[N];\n} Ring;\n\nint enqueue(Ring *r, unsigned char value) {\n  if ((r->head - r->tail) == N) return 0; // full\n  r->data[r->head & (N - 1)] = value;\n  r->head++;\n  return 1;\n}\nint dequeue(Ring *r, unsigned char *out) {\n  if (r->head == r->tail) return 0; // empty\n  *out = r->data[r->tail & (N - 1)];\n  r->tail++;\n  return 1;\n}\n```\n\n## Follow-up Questions\n\n- How would you modify for multi-producer/multi-consumer?\n- What memory-ordering considerations arise on weakly-ordered architectures?","diagram":"flowchart TD\n  A[Head/Tail] --> B[Mask: (N-1)]\n  B --> C[Enqueue path]\n  B --> D[Dequeue path]\n  C --> E[Increment Head]\n  D --> F[Increment Tail]\n  E --> G{Full?}\n  F --> H{Empty?}","difficulty":"beginner","tags":["low-level"],"channel":"low-level","subChannel":"general","sourceUrl":null,"videos":{"shortVideo":null,"longVideo":null},"companies":["Discord","Hugging Face","Instacart"],"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-11T15:59:22.270Z","createdAt":"2026-01-11T15:59:22.270Z"}],"subChannels":["general"],"companies":["Discord","Hugging Face","Instacart"],"stats":{"total":1,"beginner":1,"intermediate":0,"advanced":0,"newThisWeek":1}}
