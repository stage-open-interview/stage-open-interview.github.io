A regional outage blocks access from that region. How would you achieve **RPO ≤ 60s** and **RTO ≤ 15 minutes** by restoring to **eu-west-1**? Compare cross-region read replicas, backup copy, and Aurora Global Database, and outline concrete steps, knobs, and caveats?","answer":"Prefer Aurora Global Database for true cross-region DR with <60s RPO and <15m RTO. If constrained to RDS PostgreSQL, copy automated backups to eu-west-1 and create a read replica there; promote replic","explanation":"## Why This Is Asked\nDR planning across AWS regions is a core skill. This question tests understanding of RPO/RTO, replication guarantees, and the trade-offs between RDS Cross-Region Replicas, snapshot copying, and Aurora Global Database.\n\n## Key Concepts\n- RPO vs RTO and replication lag\n- Cross-region DR options: RDS read replicas, snapshot copy, Aurora Global DB\n- Failover orchestration and DNS routing\n\n## Code Example\n```javascript\n// AWS CLI example: copy a snapshot to another region\naws rds copy-db-snapshot --source-db-snapshot-identifier arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:snapshot:mydb-2026-01-01 --target-db-snapshot-identifier eu-west-1-mydb-2026-01-01 --source-region us-east-1 --region eu-west-1\n\n// Restore a DB instance from the cross-region snapshot\naws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot --db-instance-identifier eu-west-1-mydb-restored --db-snapshot-identifier eu-west-1-mydb-2026-01-01\n```\n\n## Follow-up Questions\n- How would you automate the failover and DNS switch?\n- What monitoring would you put in place to detect lag and test RPO/RTO?","diagram":"flowchart TD\n A[Source: RDS us-east-1] --> B{Strategy}\n B --> C[Aurora Global Database]\n B --> D[Cross-region backups + EU replica]\n C --> E[Fast RTO, low RPO]\n D --> F[Longer RPO, slower failover]","difficulty":"beginner","tags":["aws-database-specialty"],"channel":"aws-database-specialty","subChannel":"general","sourceUrl":null,"videos":{"shortVideo":null,"longVideo":null},"companies":["LinkedIn","Slack","Tesla"],"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":true,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-12T17:26:08.106Z","createdAt":"2026-01-12T17:26:08.106Z"}],"subChannels":["general"],"companies":["Adobe","Airbnb","Amazon","Apple","Coinbase","Databricks","Discord","DoorDash","Goldman Sachs","Google","Hashicorp","Hugging Face","IBM","LinkedIn","Lyft","Meta","Microsoft","MongoDB","NVIDIA","Robinhood","Slack","Snap","Snowflake","Square","Stripe","Tesla","Two Sigma","Uber","Zoom"],"stats":{"total":16,"beginner":1,"intermediate":8,"advanced":7,"newThisWeek":16}}
