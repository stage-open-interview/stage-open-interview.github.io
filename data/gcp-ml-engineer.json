Propose a deployment and feature governance pattern using Vertex AI, Feature Store, Private Service Connect, Data Catalog, and Pub/Sub to isolate customer data, manage per-tenant feature lifecycles, perform drift monitoring, and enable tenant-specific canary rollouts with automated rollback and cost controls. Include concrete components, data flow, and rollback criteria?","answer":"Use a per-tenant project and separate datasets; expose a single endpoint with traffic-split by tenant via Vertex AI Endpoints with canary deployments per tenant. Store features per-tenant in Feature S","explanation":"## Why This Is Asked\n\nTests ability to design a scalable, compliant ML service with strict data isolation across tenants, a common real-world constraint.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n- Multi-tenant data isolation and policy enforcement\n- Vertex AI Endpoints and canary deployments per tenant\n- Feature Store per-tenant featureviews and telemetry via Pub/Sub\n- Model Monitoring, drift-driven rollback, and cost controls\n\n## Code Example\n\n```python\n# Pseudo-code: create canary deployment per tenant (illustrative)\nfrom google.cloud import aiplatform\nendpoint = aiplatform.Endpoint(\".../endpoints/...\")\nendpoint.deploy_model(\n  display_name=\"tenant-a-canary\",\n  model_id=\"projects/.../models/...\",\n  dedicated_resources=None,\n  traffic_split={\"0\": 0.2, \"1\": 0.8},\n)\n```\n\n## Follow-up Questions\n\n- How would you design alerting thresholds for drift vs latency?\n- How would you test tenant-specific policy changes before rollout?\n","diagram":"flowchart TD\n  TenantIsolation[Tenant Isolation] --> Endpoint[Vertex AI Endpoint per Tenant]\n  Endpoint --> Canary[Canary Deploy per Tenant]\n  Canary --> Telemetry[Telemetry via Pub/Sub]\n  Telemetry --> Dataflow[Feature Ingestion & Materialization]\n  Endpoint --> Drift[Model Monitoring]\n  Drift --> Rollback[Auto Rollback on Drift/Latency]\n  Policy[Policy & Retention via Data Catalog/IAM] --> DataStore[Storage & Cost Controls]","difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["gcp-ml-engineer"],"channel":"gcp-ml-engineer","subChannel":"general","sourceUrl":null,"videos":{"shortVideo":null,"longVideo":null},"companies":["Amazon","Meta"],"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":true,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-12T16:41:58.596Z","createdAt":"2026-01-12T16:41:58.596Z"}],"subChannels":["data-prep","general"],"companies":["Adobe","Airbnb","Amazon","Anthropic","Apple","Bloomberg","Citadel","Cloudflare","Coinbase","Databricks","Discord","DoorDash","Goldman Sachs","Google","IBM","Instacart","LinkedIn","Lyft","Meta","Microsoft","MongoDB","NVIDIA","Netflix","Oracle","PayPal","Plaid","Robinhood","Salesforce","Scale Ai","Snap","Snowflake","Square","Stripe","Tesla","Twitter","Two Sigma","Uber"],"stats":{"total":27,"beginner":9,"intermediate":10,"advanced":8,"newThisWeek":27}}
