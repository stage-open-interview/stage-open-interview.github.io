Implementing a lifecycle policy that auto-migrates infrequently accessed data to Cool/Archive while keeping hot data in Hot delivers cost savings without sacrificing analytics performance. The other options are suboptimal: a overprovisioning all data in Hot increases cost; c sacrifices accessibility and performance for hot data; d introduces on-prem complexity and latency.","diagram":null,"difficulty":"intermediate","tags":["Azure","AzureBlobStorage","AzureDataLake","LifecycleManagement","CostOptimization","Terraform","AWS","Kubernetes","certification-mcq","domain-weight-20"],"channel":"azure-solutions-architect","subChannel":"design-data-storage","sourceUrl":null,"videos":null,"companies":null,"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-12T14:23:50.378Z","createdAt":"2026-01-12 14:23:50"},{"id":"azure-solutions-architect-design-data-storage-1768227830375-1","question":"A financial services company processes massive time-series sensor data that is appended and needs to be queried across multiple regions with low latency.

A time-based immutability policy (blob immutability) enforces non-deletion for the specified period, satisfying regulatory retention.

Auto-failover groups provide coordinated, automatic failover and failback across regions for Azure SQL Database, minimizing downtime and RPO.
