details.\n\n**Sub-Question 1: Core Multi-Region Architecture with Real-Time Processing**\n\n**Architecture Overview:**\n- **Primary Region (East US)**: Live bid processing with Event Hubs Standard tier (20 throughput units)\n- **Secondary Region (West US)**: Disaster recovery with Event Hubs Geo-DR pairing\n- **Data Processing**: Stream Analytics jobs (6 SUs) for real-time bid validation and enrichment\n- **Storage Layer**: ADLS Gen2 with hierarchical namespace, geo-redundant storage (GZRS)\n\n**Complete Data Flow:**\n1. **Ingestion**: API Gateway → Event Hubs (Partition key: tenantId)\n2. **Real-time Processing**: Stream Analytics → Function Apps for ML scoring → Event Hubs (processed)\n3. **Raw Storage**: Event Hubs Capture → ADLS Gen2 (Bronze tier)\n4. **Transformation**: Synapse Spark pools (Large, 50 vCores) → Silver/Gold tiers\n5. **Analytics**: Dedicated SQL pools (DW1000c) per tenant segment\n\n**Sub-Question 2: Tenant Isolation, Security, and Compliance**\n\n**Per-Tenant Isolation Strategy:**\n- **Logical Separation**: Synapse workspaces with dedicated SQL pools segmented by tenantId\n- **Network Isolation**: VNet injection with private endpoints, NSG rules per tenant subnet\n- **Access Control**: Azure AD groups per tenant, RBAC role assignments at workspace level\n\n**Security Implementation:**\n- **BYOK**: Azure Key Vault with customer-managed HSM keys for ADLS encryption\n- **Confidential Computing**: DC-series VMs for Spark processing with Intel SGX\n- **Data Protection**: Microsoft Purview for data classification, Azure Policy for compliance\n\n**Cross-Region Replication:**\n- **Event Hubs**: Geo-disaster recovery with automatic failover (RTO < 5 minutes)\n- **ADLS**: GZRS with zone redundancy within regions, cross-region read access\n- **Synapse**: Pause/resume capabilities in secondary region for cost optimization\n\n**Access Controls:**\n- **Identity**: Azure AD B2B for external advertiser access\n- **Authorization**: ABAC policies based on tenantId, resource tags\n- **Monitoring**: Azure Sentinel for threat detection across tenant boundaries\n\n**Cost Optimization Levers:**\n- **Compute**: Spot instances for batch processing, reserved instances for baseline workloads\n- **Storage**: Lifecycle management (Hot → Cool → Archive after 30/90/365 days)\n- **Streaming**: Auto-inflate for Event Hubs (2-20 TUs based on load)\n- **Synapse**: Serverless SQL for ad-hoc queries, dedicated pools only for scheduled workloads\n\n**Testing Strategy:**\n- **Performance**: Load testing with Azure Load Testing (100K RPS simulation)\n- **DR**: Chaos Engineering with Azure Chaos Studio (regional failover tests monthly)\n- **Security**: Penetration testing with Microsoft Defender for Cloud quarterly\n- **Data Governance**: Automated compliance scans with Azure Policy","explanation":"## Why This Approach Works\n\n**Focused Sub-Questions**: Breaking the complex scenario into two manageable parts allows candidates to demonstrate expertise in both streaming architecture and security/compliance without being overwhelmed.\n\n**Real-World Relevance**: This mirrors actual enterprise ad-tech
