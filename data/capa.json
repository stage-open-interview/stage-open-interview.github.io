{"questions":[{"id":"q-841","question":"Design a CAPA workflow for a high-volume platform (Airbnb/LinkedIn scale). The system must log incidents, perform RCA, implement corrective and preventive actions, and verify outcomes before closing. Provide: 1) a CAPA data model, 2) a lifecycle state machine, 3) an API surface to create/update CAPAs, 4) metrics to prove effectiveness (recurrence rate, time-to-close)?","answer":"Propose: Incident → RCA → corrective action → preventive action → verification → closed. CAPA data: id, incident_id, root_cause, actions[], owner, status, due, evidence, metrics. State machine: Open →","explanation":"## Why This Is Asked\n\nThis question probes the candidate's ability to design a scalable CAPA workflow, integrating incident management with RCA, corrective/preventive actions, and verification. It also tests data modeling, API design, and measurable outcomes for compliance and quality.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n- CAPA lifecycle\n- RCA techniques\n- Data modeling\n- Observability metrics\n- Compliance/audit trails\n\n## Code Example\n\n```javascript\nclass CAPA {\n  constructor(id, incidentId) {\n    this.id = id;\n    this.incidentId = incidentId;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Follow-up Questions\n\n- How would you test the CAPA workflow end-to-end?\n- How would you handle concurrency and race conditions in CAPA creation?\n- What privacy and retention considerations apply?","diagram":"flowchart TD\n  Incident --> RCA\n  RCA --> Action\n  Action --> Verification\n  Verification --> Closed","difficulty":"advanced","tags":["capa"],"channel":"capa","subChannel":"general","sourceUrl":null,"videos":{"shortVideo":null,"longVideo":null},"companies":["Airbnb","LinkedIn"],"eli5":null,"relevanceScore":null,"voiceKeywords":null,"voiceSuitable":false,"isNew":false,"lastUpdated":"2026-01-12T13:25:13.492Z","createdAt":"2026-01-12T13:25:13.492Z"}],"subChannels":["general"],"companies":["Airbnb","LinkedIn"],"stats":{"total":1,"beginner":0,"intermediate":0,"advanced":1,"newThisWeek":1}}
