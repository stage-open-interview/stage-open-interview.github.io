  <title>You&#039;re maintaining an AWS-native, real-time ML system for a ride-hailing recommender. Design an end-to-end pipeline that ingests user events via Kinesis/S3, preprocesses with Glue/Lambda, stores features in SageMaker Feature Store, trains and registers models in SageMaker, deploys with canary endpoint aliases, and uses Model Monitor to detect drift. Include privacy protections (PII redaction, encryption), IAM, and drift-triggered rollback with audit trails. How would you implement this?</title>
