  <title>You&#039;re tasked with building a real-time anomaly detection model for a high-volume payment processor. The system must run under 5 ms latency per event on CPU, process tabular data with high-cardinality categorical features, handle concept drift, and provide feature-level explanations for regulatory audits. Propose an end-to-end architecture, model choices, deployment plan (including feature store, model registry, and on-device vs server), drift detection strategy, and evaluation plan (online/offline, backtesting)?</title>
