  <title>Design a scalable Azure OpenAI-powered policy-compliance assistant for a regulated enterprise serving multiple tenants. It should run behind API Management, use a tenant-scoped knowledge base in Azure Blob and embedding-grounded search in Azure Cognitive Search, and enforce data governance: per-tenant isolation, model-versioning aligned to policy epochs, and an explicit source-explanation chain with a trust score. Include a degradation path that falls back to a cached offline policy. Outline end-to-end data flow, components, and a concise test plan?</title>
