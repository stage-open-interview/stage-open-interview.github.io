  <title>In a Databricks environment, you receive a daily JSON feed of fintech transactions from a partner S3 bucket. Build a three-table pipeline: Bronze Delta with Auto Loader and schema evolution, Silver Delta that upserts deduplicating by transaction_id, and Gold that aggregates daily totals by customer_id. The JSON evolves (new fields like merchant_id and currency). Explain how you&#039;d implement schema evolution, a MERGE based upsert, and partitioning by transaction_date. Include a lightweight data quality test plan and PII masking in outputs?</title>
