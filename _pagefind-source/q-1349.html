  <title>Two AWS accounts across us-east-1 and us-west-2 host a data science platform with multiple VPCs. Design a scalable, secure network that minimizes cross-region data transfer, keeps east-west private, and supports easy onboarding of new accounts. Requirements: hub Transit Gateway across regions, centralized outbound egress via a shared firewall stack, private access to S3/data lake using PrivateLink with Private DNS, IPv6 dual-stack readiness, and automatic account onboarding. Explain architecture, routing, firewall policy model, cost controls, and observability?</title>
