  <title>In a two-site WAN using OSPF and NAT-ed Internet access, a new branch subnet experiences intermittent Internet and DNS failures during business hours. No application changes. Provide a concrete diagnostic plan to determine whether (a) DHCP address conflicts, (b) edge switch CAM/ARP storms, (c) NAT pool exhaustion or port translation limits, or (d) firewall session limits or rate-limiting are responsible, with exact commands and data to collect, and propose mitigations preserving branch connectivity?</title>
