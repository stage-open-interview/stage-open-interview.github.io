  <title>Design an end-to-end GCP ML pipeline to orchestrate thousands of edge ML models across a geo-distributed device fleet using Vertex AI Edge Manager. Ingest device telemetry via Pub/Sub, preprocess with Dataflow, store offline features in BigQuery, train centralized models in Vertex AI, and deploy edge-revision canaries with region-specific rollouts. Include automatic rollback on drift/latency violations, per-tenant isolation, security with KMS, and cost controls?</title>
