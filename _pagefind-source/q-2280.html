  <title>In a simplified OS with a file-backed page cache, a process repeatedly calls read() to fetch 4 KiB blocks from a file. If a 4 KiB block is not in the file system page cache, describe step-by-step what the kernel does from read() entry to user-space return, including page-cache lookup, block-device reads, potential read-ahead, and how the data ends up in the user buffer. Compare a cache miss vs a cache hit path and timing?</title>
