  <title>In a Consul Connect mesh spanning Kubernetes and Nomad, a gRPC streaming client on service &#039;orders-bridge&#039; intermittently fails to connect to &#039;inventory-backend&#039; after a CA rotation and mesh gateway policy update. The failure seems TLS handshake completes but ALPN negotiation fails, causing HTTP/2 streaming to drop. Design an end-to-end debugging workflow to isolate whether the issue is (a) SPIFFE identity propagation, (b) ALPN negotiation across sidecars, or (c) service DNS/registration, with concrete commands, config checks, and rollback steps?</title>
