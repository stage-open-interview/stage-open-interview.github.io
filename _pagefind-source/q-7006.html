  <title>You&#039;re building a social app&#039;s activity feed service that stores per-user posts in a distributed data store. To scale, shard by user_id using a fixed shard count and replicate each shard to two or three nodes. Describe how you would design shard management, online rebalancing, and read-after-write guarantees to users, while mitigating hotspot users. Include concrete placement, replication, and failure handling strategies?</title>
