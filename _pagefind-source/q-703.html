  <title>You&#039;re navigating a warehouse grid of size n x m. Each cell (i, j) has a risk value r[i][j] ≥ 0, where higher means less safe. You may move only right or down from (0,0) to (n-1,m-1). Devise a dynamic-programming solution to minimize the maximum risk encountered on the path (i.e., minimize max(r[i][j]) along the path). Define a suitable dp[i][j], give the recurrence and base cases, describe reconstruction of the path, and analyze time/space complexity. How would you handle blocked cells by setting r[i][j] = INF?</title>
