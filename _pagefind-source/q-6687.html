  <title>In a Consul Connect mesh on Kubernetes, an external partner app routes to internal &#039;order-service&#039; via an ingress mesh gateway. After enabling a partner tenant, requests intermittently fail with 502s during peak load while TLS handshakes succeed. Provide a beginner-friendly end-to-end debugging workflow that isolates whether the issue is gateway policy, service identity (TLS SAN), or DNS alias resolution when routing through the gateway. Include concrete commands, config checks, and a rollback plan?</title>
