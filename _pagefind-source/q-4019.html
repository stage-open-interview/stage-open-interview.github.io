  <title>Design an on-device analytics module for an iOS app that preserves user privacy. The module should: record lightweight events locally; batch and aggregate them into daily buckets; upload via a background URLSession with exponential backoff and jitter; honor a user opt-in/opt-out toggle and per-event consent; persist across restarts. Explain data model (Core Data or SQLite), storage lifecycle, encryption, and a test plan that simulates offline, partial writes, and data corruption?</title>
