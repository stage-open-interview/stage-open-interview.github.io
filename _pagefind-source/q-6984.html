  <title>Design a KCA workflow for a distributed personal data vault where a user&#039;s devices (laptop, phone, wearable) boot with hardware-backed roots (TPM/TEE), attest to a regional bootstrap service, and enroll a CSR to a central KCA that issues a short-lived TLS certificate only after a 3-of-N device quorum signs an attestation bundle. Include per-user SPIFFE IDs, cross-region trust anchors, policy binding with device-type constraints, crypto agility, and a test plan focusing on churn, re-enrollment latency, and revocation propagation?</title>
