  <title>Design a KCA workflow for a real-time analytics platform spanning on‑prem data collectors, cloud streaming services, and a Snowflake data lake. Each collector boots with a hardware-backed root, attests to a regional bootstrap service, and enrolls a CSR to a central KCA that issues a short-lived TLS certificate (TTL 300s) bound to a per-tenant SPIFFE ID and a &#039;streaming-analytics&#039; scope. Include cross-region trust anchors, policy propagation with 1-minute renewals, offline revocation, auditing, and a test plan focused on bursty ingestion, clock skew, and certificate rotation latency?</title>
