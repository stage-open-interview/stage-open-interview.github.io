  <title>Ingest 5TB/day of JSON clickstream into Snowflake. Build a compliant pipeline that: (1) ingests into RAW.clickstream, (2) deduplicates by event_id, (3) masks user_id via a masking policy for downstream views, (4) computes hourly active users in the last 24h and stores in hourly_clicks, (5) publishes a governed subset to a partner via secure data sharing with a read-only view and access controls, plus tests and alerting. How would you implement it?</title>
