  <title>You&#039;re managing six engineering teams across regions for a real-time ride-hailing platform with strict SLOs. A regional outage hits the payments service and causes cascading latency in ride matching. Teams disagree on root cause (network policy, code change, or DB shard). Propose a concrete 48-hour incident plan: triage ownership, capacity reallocation, rollback vs hotfix strategy, testing approach, and a postmortem cadence. Include milestones and go/no-go criteria?</title>
