  <title>In a Netflix-scale data plane with a Snowflake-like warehouse and a streaming telemetry pipeline, design a security model that lets analysts query per-tenant telemetry without data leakage. Include: data-at-rest and in-motion protections, RBAC/ABAC with row-level security, dynamic masking, key management with HSM/KMS, service-to-service mTLS, runtime attestation for analytics jobs, SBOM enforcement, and an incident response playbook. Provide concrete tech choices and trade-offs?</title>
