  <title>In a globally distributed network using Segment Routing with IPv6 (SRv6) across three regions, inter-region traffic experiences sporadic long-tail latency due to per-flow path selection not aligning with ECMP groupings. Without changing applications, propose a concrete diagnostic plan to determine whether per-flow SID steering, TE-rule misconfig, or ingress replication is causing instability, including exact commands and data to collect, and propose a robust mitigation that preserves ECMP while stabilizing latency?</title>
