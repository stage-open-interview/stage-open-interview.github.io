  <title>You&#039;re building a real-time fraud-detection system for a streaming e-commerce platform with multimodal data: tabular signals, text reviews, and time-series events. Data is high-velocity, highly imbalanced, and privacy-constrained. Propose an end-to-end architecture that processes streams with concept-drift handling, delivers low latency (&lt;100 ms per event), and preserves privacy via on-device or DP/FL. What models, data pipelines, and evaluation approach would you choose, and why?</title>
