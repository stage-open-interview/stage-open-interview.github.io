  <title>Advanced interview: In a production ML platform used by Tesla, Databricks, and PayPal, ensure every ML model artifact (weights, config) and its data dependencies are signed, attested, and verifiable before deployment to inference endpoints. Design a policy-driven end-to-end pipeline: 1) signing workflow with Cosign, 2) attestation storage with Rekor, 3) pre-deployment checks enforcing Rekor attestations and an SBOM, and 4) a test plan that detects tampering and blocks deployment. Include concrete Cosign commands and a sample Rekor layout?</title>
