  <title>For a real-time ML inference platform deployed on Kubernetes, how would you secure the model supply chain from training to inference against tampering and exfiltration? Design a defense-in-depth plan covering artifact signing, reproducible builds, SBOM enforcement, a secure model registry with per-model access controls, runtime attestation, and an incident-playbook including rollback and revocation steps. List concrete technologies and trade-offs?</title>
