  <title>Design a streaming ELT pipeline that ingests real-time user activity from Azure Event Hubs into Delta Lake on ADLS Gen2, handles schema drift with dynamic inference, maintains an SCD Type 2 customer dimension, and captures end-to-end lineage in Purview. Which processing engine would you choose (Synapse Spark vs Databricks) and why, and how would you configure partitioning, watermarking, upserts, and autoscale to balance latency, cost, and reliability?</title>
