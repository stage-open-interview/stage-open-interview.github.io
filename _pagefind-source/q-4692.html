  <title>Design a robust lock-free multi-producer, single-consumer ring buffer used for inter-thread messaging with two producers and one consumer. Each slot holds a 64-bit key, a 64-bit value, and a 64-bit sequence. Describe the protocol (indices, per-slot sequence), the exact memory barriers required on x86_64 and ARM64, and a minimal code sketch for enqueue and dequeue. Include a concrete test plan that stresses visibility, wrap-around, and ABA issues?</title>
