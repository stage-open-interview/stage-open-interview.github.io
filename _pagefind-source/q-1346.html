  <title>On a production Linux host serving multiple ephemeral monitoring daemons, a heartbeat worker must emit a 5-second ping to a central collector. During peak load, the heartbeat misses several intervals, delaying alerts. Propose a concrete production plan to guarantee cadence and resilience using: (a) per-service CPU isolation and pinning, (b) high-priority timer/RT scheduling or systemd timers with precise tuning, (c) a fallback mechanism for missed heartbeats, and (d) a validation strategy with a controlled load. Include concrete config snippets for systemd, cpuset, and timer settings?</title>
