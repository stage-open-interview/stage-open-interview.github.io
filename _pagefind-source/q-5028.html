  <title>You&#039;re designing a beginner AWS-only pipeline for user feedback files uploaded to S3 as JSON (≤1 MB). On upload, validate schema with Lambda, use Amazon Comprehend to extract sentiment and key phrases, synthesize a spoken summary with Amazon Polly, store both transcript and audio in S3, and upsert a DynamoDB index with feedbackId, transcriptKey, audioKey, sentiment, and topKeywords. Include IAM least privilege, error handling, privacy controls, and cost considerations. How would you implement and test this end-to-end?</title>
