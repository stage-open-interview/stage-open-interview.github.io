  <title>Design a dynamic, multi-source shortest-path maintenance scheme for a directed graph with nonnegative weights. A fixed set of K hub nodes H must always have exact shortest-path distances to all nodes. Edges can be inserted or weights decreased online, in batches of size at most B. Provide initial preprocessing and a full-update algorithm, with (i) initial time, (ii) amortized update time per batch, and (iii) memory usage. Include two practical optimizations and compare to recomputing from scratch after each batch?</title>
