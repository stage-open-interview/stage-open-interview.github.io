  <title>You&#039;re deploying a single on-device model for real-time video analytics on an edge device with 12 ms per frame latency and 200 MB RAM. The model must perform both object detection and semantic segmentation. Describe a concrete plan to meet latency while preserving accuracy: architecture choices (shared backbone, task heads, feature pyramids), training strategies (loss weighting, distillation, data augmentation), deployment optimizations (quantization, operator fusion, memory layout, early exits), and validation strategy (latency budgets, mAP, mIoU, robustness across weather)?</title>
