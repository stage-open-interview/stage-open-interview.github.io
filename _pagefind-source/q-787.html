  <title>You maintain N players with integer scores in the range 0..10000. You must support two online operations: 1) update(i, s) — set player i&#039;s score to s; 2) countLE(X) — return how many players have score &lt;= X. Propose a data structure and algorithm to support both in O(log V) time per operation, where V=10001, and analyze space usage. Include initialization and a brief correctness sketch?</title>
