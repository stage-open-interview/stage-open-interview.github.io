  <title>Design an end-to-end provenance and runtime integrity workflow for pluggable CNF plugins deployed across multiple tenants in a federated Kubernetes cluster. Requirements: (1) sign plugin images with Cosign using a KMS-backed key and attach SPDX SBOMs, (2) publish a per-plugin trust score from a central verifier, (3) gate upgrades with ImagePolicyWebhook and Kyverno/OPA that require signature, SBOM, and fresh attestation, (4) surface tenant-scoped visibility of trust and upgrade status, (5) include minimal in-namespace manifests and commands to validate end-to-end in a test namespace before broader rollout?</title>
