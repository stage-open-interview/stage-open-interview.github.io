  <title>You&#039;re building a read-heavy analytics API that caches per-user daily summaries in Redis and Memcached. When a user performs an action that changes their summary, the cached entry must be invalidated and rebuilt on the next read. Design a practical cache invalidation approach that minimizes drift and avoids cache stampede. Include (a) the read path and data structures you would use, (b) how you trigger invalidation on writes, (c) handling bulk invalidation for many users in a single event, and (d) a basic testing approach to verify correctness?</title>
