  <title>Describe a time you mediated a conflict between two squads (e.g., Payments backend and Mobile SDK) during a high-stakes release where you had no formal authority. How did you structure the negotiation, what metrics did you surface (p95 latency, error budgets, risk), what mediation techniques did you use (private caucuses, joint workshop, decision log), and what was the measurable impact?</title>
