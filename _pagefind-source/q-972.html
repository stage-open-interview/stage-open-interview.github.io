  <title>In a dbt analytics project deployed to Snowflake, three tenants share a common model but data is isolated by schema prefixes (tenant_a_, tenant_b_, tenant_c_). Describe how you would structure tenancy-aware tests and a test runner to prevent cross-tenant data leakage during PR runs. Include how you configure sources, seeds, and per-tenant test filtering, and how you verify isolation in CI without touching production data?</title>
