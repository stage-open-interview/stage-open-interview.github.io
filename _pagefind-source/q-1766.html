  <title>In a global data service using DNS-based global load balancing across us-east-1 and eu-west-1, cross-region reads spike latency during peak hours while intra-region calls remain fast. No app changes allowed. Outline a concrete diagnostic plan to distinguish stale DNS routing, BGP route flaps, and edge TLS termination delays, with exact commands and data you’d collect, interpretation rules, and recommended mitigations?</title>
