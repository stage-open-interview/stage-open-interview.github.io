  <title>Maintain a dynamic 2D point set P in the plane. Points are appended in online batches of size B (i -&gt; (x_i,y_i)); never deleted. After each batch, report the area of the convex hull of all points seen so far. Propose a practical batched rebuild data structure: (i) a base hull H for old points, (ii) a buffer U for the new batch, (iii) a rebuild threshold after T batches, with amortized update and query times. Include preprocessing, memory, two optimizations, and a comparison to rebuilding from scratch after every batch?</title>
