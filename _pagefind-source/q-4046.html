  <title>Scenario: A log analytics service processes a high-velocity stream of user IDs and needs the number of unique users in the last W events (sliding window). Design two practical strategies to maintain that count as IDs arrive: (A) recompute from scratch for every window; (B) maintain a hash-map of counts and update incrementally. Provide asymptotics for time and space in terms of N, W, and batch size B, and compare to a full recompute after each batch?</title>
