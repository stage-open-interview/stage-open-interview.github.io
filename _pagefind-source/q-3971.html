  <title>Scenario: A DAG G=(V,E) with a fixed source S. Each edge e=(u,v) contributes 1 path along that edge; the number of distinct S→v paths is computed by DP over a topological order. Edges can be inserted online in batches of size B. Propose a practical hybrid scheme that maintains exact path counts to all v after each batch using (i) an incremental update pass limited to affected nodes, (ii) a periodic full recomputation every T batches, and (iii) a lazy rebuild trigger when incremental cost exceeds a threshold. Include initial preprocessing, amortized update time per batch, memory bounds, two optimizations, and a comparison to re-running the full DP after every batch?</title>
