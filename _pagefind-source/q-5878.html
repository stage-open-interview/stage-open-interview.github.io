  <title>You&#039;re deploying a multilingual, retrieval-augmented coding assistant used by Discord, Meta, and Apple engineers to answer API usage and security guidelines. The model sometimes fabricates endpoint details or cites stale docs. Design a concrete evaluation plan that (1) detects hallucinations not only in facts but also in cited passages, (2) verifies faithfulness to a live API spec snapshot and in-session context, and (3) measures output stability under concurrent requests with per-answer source anchors. Include datasets, metrics, tooling, and a minimal eval script?</title>
