  <title>You’re building a real-time social feed in React Native (Twitter-like) where posts include text and media. Updates come over WebSocket and the network is flaky. Describe an architecture to render the feed with optimistic UI, handle out-of-order events, deduplicate, and persist a local feed in WatermelonDB/SQLite. Include a useFeedLive() hook sketch and a minimal UI snippet that demonstrates optimistic like/upvote and an offline action queue that syncs when online. What trade-offs do you consider?</title>
