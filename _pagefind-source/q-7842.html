  <title>Scenario: A tiny access-control policy with four booleans A..D in {T, F, U}. Constraints: (A ∨ B) → C, (B ∧ D) → ¬A, and (¬D) → (A ∨ C). Additionally, exactly one of A and B is U. Is there an assignment satisfying all constraints with exactly one U among A,B? Outline a 3-valued backtracking propagator to verify such rule-sets and show a concrete satisfying assignment?</title>
