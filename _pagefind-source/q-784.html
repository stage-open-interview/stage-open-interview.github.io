  <title>Design a deterministic, time-sliced barrier for a three-stage streaming pipeline on a 2-socket x86-64 system. Each stage runs on a fixed subset of cores; implement a barrier that advances phases only after every core finishes its assigned slice within a bounded time. Explain how to ensure bounded latency under cache-line contention, preserve MESI coherence, and prevent starvation. Provide pseudo-code for enter_barrier for a core and discuss validation?</title>
