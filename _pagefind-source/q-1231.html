  <title>In a smart conference room, 6 microphones capture audio while 2 cameras provide synchronized lip-movement visuals. Propose an ICA-based pipeline to jointly separate independent audio sources and align them to speaker identities using visual cues as auxiliary information. Include (i) whitening and joint diagonalization strategy, (ii) how to integrate visual cues into the contrast to improve permutation recovery, (iii) online adaptation for moving speakers, and (iv) a concrete evaluation plan with ground-truth sources and lip-sync metrics?</title>
