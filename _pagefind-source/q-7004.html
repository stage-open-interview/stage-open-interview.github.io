  <title>New angle: Ingest daily partner shipments from two sources (CSV/JSON) into ADLS Gen2. Build a beginner Data Factory pipeline that (1) stages raw files under /landing/shipments/raw, (2) validates a lightweight schema (shipment_id, date, amount, partner_id) and data types, (3) on drift or faults, moves files to /landing/shipments/errors and raises an alert, (4) on success, loads conformant data into a simple star schema in Azure Synapse, and (5) registers provenance in Purview. What steps and components would you implement?</title>
