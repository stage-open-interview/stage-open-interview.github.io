  <title>In a two-region deployment (Region A and Region B) across two AWS accounts per region, tenants are isolated in VPCs attached to regional Transit Gateways. Design a DR-ready network that preserves private east–west traffic, ensures tenant isolation during regional outage, and enables automatic failover of control-plane services to the DR region. Propose TGW topology with a DR region, synchronized PrivateLink services, replicated firewall rules, and a testing/validation plan with telemetry?</title>
