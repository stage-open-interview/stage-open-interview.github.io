  <title>Scenario: A consumer analytics app collects 35 numeric features per user session, many features highly correlated and some missing. You need a beginner PCA-based feature extractor on-device (mobile) to reduce to 6 components before syncing to the backend. Describe how you would handle missing values, scaling, variance-based feature pruning, selecting the number of components, and how to translate top loadings into concrete in-app signals while keeping the client footprint small?</title>
