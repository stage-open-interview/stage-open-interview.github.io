  <title>Build a real-time fraud scoring pipeline on Azure for a multi-tenant fintech. Ingest 60k msgs/sec via Event Hubs, run scoring in Azure ML, store per-tenant results in Cosmos DB with region-bound writes, and publish to downstream systems. How would you enforce per-tenant data residency, hit sub-200ms latency, support hot model updates, and ensure end-to-end auditability and replay safety? Include regional failover and RBAC?</title>
