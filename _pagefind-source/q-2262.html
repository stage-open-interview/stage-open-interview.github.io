  <title>How would you implement an end-to-end runtime-provenance strategy for upgrades in a three-region, air-gapped CNF platform hosting stateful gateways across Kubernetes clusters, without pulling new images from the registry? Include image provenance checks, TPM-backed attestation via Sigstore, in-cluster drift detection with eBPF, and a safe, low-downtime rollback plan with minimal manifests?</title>
