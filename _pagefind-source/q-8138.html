  <title>Maintain a dynamic union length of intervals in [0,1]. You start with an empty set. You receive online batches of B interval insertions (l, r) with 0 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1. After each batch, output the total measure of the union of all intervals. Propose a practical data structure, its preprocessing, update amortized cost per batch, and how its complexity scales with n total intervals, B, and coordinate size. Compare to rebuilding the union after each batch?</title>
