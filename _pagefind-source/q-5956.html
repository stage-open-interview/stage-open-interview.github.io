  <title>Scenario: A Linux host running a distributed log-collector experiences sporadic 100-300 ms pauses during bursts. CPU, I/O, and free memory look normal. Using only default tooling, design a concrete diagnostic workflow to (1) prove whether cache/TLB misses or lock contention cause the pauses, (2) pinpoint the offending thread(s) and kernel path (e.g., mmap region, page faults, or IRQs), and (3) apply a safe mitigation (e.g., pin frequently woken threads, adjust CPU affinity, NUMA locality, or reduce contention) while preserving observability. Include exact commands and expected outputs?</title>
