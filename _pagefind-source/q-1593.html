  <title>In a cross-account ETL job: a service in Account A needs to copy only files tagged ETL=Allowed from a bucket in Account B, over a private VPC endpoint, with data at rest encrypted by a central CMK. Design the least-privilege pattern: trust policy for a cross-account role, bucket and KMS policies, and how you would enforce per-object tag-based access. Include how you’d validate no privilege creep and that logs are immutable?</title>
