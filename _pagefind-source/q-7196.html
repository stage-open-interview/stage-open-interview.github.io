  <title>Design and implement a streaming inner-join operator in Python that consumes two asynchronous NDJSON streams and joins on user_id. Validate items with Pydantic; keep per-user buffers bounded; emit joined records as soon as a match exists while preserving per-user order and providing backpressure to sources. Include tests for skewed distributions and bursty arrivals?</title>
