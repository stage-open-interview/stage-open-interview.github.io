  <title>In an e-commerce platform with a PostgreSQL database, you have a products table (10M rows) with columns: id, category_id, brand_id, price, created_at, stock_count, is_active. The application frequently runs queries filtering by (category_id, brand_id) with price ranges and sorting by created_at. Design an optimal indexing strategy covering both selective and non-selective scenarios, and explain how you would handle index maintenance during bulk price updates?</title>
