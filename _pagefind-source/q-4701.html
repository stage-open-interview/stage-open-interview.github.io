  <title>Design an Azure DevOps pipeline to promote a multi-tenant frontend app from staging to production with per-tenant feature flags. Use Azure Front Door for progressive rollout (10/90 first), per-env secrets from Azure Key Vault, and traffic routing between staging and prod. Gate promotion with policy approvals. Validate post-deploy with Application Insights and Log Analytics drift checks; auto-rollback to previous frontend build if latency or error rate exceed threshold for a 15-minute window. Provide artifacts, rollback plan, and audit?</title>
