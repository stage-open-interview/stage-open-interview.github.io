  <title>Design a bounded, multi-producer, multi-consumer processing system for streaming analytics. Each event has a topic id; events within the same topic must be processed in order, but topics may run in parallel. Implement a dynamic worker pool that can grow/shrink at runtime and rebalance tasks across topics while preserving per-topic order. Include backpressure signaling when the global queue is full, fairness across topics, and a graceful shutdown that drains in-flight items per topic?</title>
