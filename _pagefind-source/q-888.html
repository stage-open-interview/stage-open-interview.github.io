  <title>A production Linux host runs a data-backup agent that uses /var/lib/backup/backup.lock to enforce a single instance. Sometimes a stale lock remains after a crash, blocking new runs; the agent also leaves non-terminating children on stop, risking partial backups. Propose a systemd‑based lifecycle fix: ensure one instance, auto-clean stale lock, and graceful stop with timeout and fallback to kill. Include concrete unit snippets and verification steps?</title>
