  <title>You&#039;re performance testing a serverless order-fulfillment workflow where a single checkout triggers a chain of 5 functions (inventory check, pricing, tax calculation, payment, notification) with 2 synchronous (pricing, payment) and 3 asynchronous via queues (inventory check, tax, notification). Validate end-to-end latency and budget constraints under 10k concurrent checkouts, considering cold starts and function concurrency limits. How would you design the test, what metrics and tooling would you use?</title>
