  <title>Design a dynamic graph connectivity data structure that processes a time-ordered sequence of operations on an undirected graph with N nodes. Supported ops: addEdge(u,v), removeEdge(u,v) (edges may be added again later), and queryComponents() to return the current number of connected components. All operations are known in advance. Describe and implement an offline solution using a segment tree over time and a rollback DSU to answer queries in O((N+Q) log Q) time. Explain edge lifespan handling and complexity trade-offs?</title>
