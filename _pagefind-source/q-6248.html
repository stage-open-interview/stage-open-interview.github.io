  <title>In a database constraint engine that uses 3-valued Kleene semantics (TRUE, FALSE, UNKNOWN), four columns A,B,C,D have values in {T, F, U}. Constraints: (A AND B) → C, (B OR D) → A, NOT D → (A OR C). Is there a row assignment with at least one UNKNOWN such that none of the constraints evaluates to FALSE?
