  <title>Design an Android module for offline-first asset-tracking in a manufacturing setting. Devices collect telemetry and RFID scans; central server publishes delta patches to annotate assets and adjust safety thresholds. Patch application must work offline using WorkManager idle windows, with per-device signing keys stored in Android Keystore and rotated nightly. Reconcile state on reconnect, expose API for current asset map version and enforcement results, and support idempotent patching with rollback. Include data model, patch format, consistency guarantees, and a test plan for offline queues, drift, and multi-device conflicts?</title>
