  <title>In a distributed telemetry pipeline for a fleet of delivery robots, producers emit events with robot_id, seq, and payload. Design a concurrency strategy to process events with per-robot in-order handling, a bounded in-flight cap, and exactly-once persistence to an external store. Requirements: 1) bounded global queue with capacity, 2) per-robot buffers to preserve order, 3) a small worker pool to apply side effects, 4) handle late/duplicate events, 5) provide a runnable sketch in Go or Rust and a test plan for ordering, liveness, and recovery. How would you implement this?</title>
