  <title>You&#039;re managing a microservices platform with 50 services. Service A has a 95th percentile latency of 200ms and handles 10,000 RPS. It calls Service B (50ms, 5,000 RPS) and Service C (100ms, 3,000 RPS). During Black Friday, you expect 5x traffic. Service A&#039;s CPU utilization is currently 60%, memory at 70%. How do you plan capacity to maintain &lt;500ms 95th percentile end-to-end latency?</title>
