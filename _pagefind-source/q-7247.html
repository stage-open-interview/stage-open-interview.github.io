  <title>Design an end-to-end automated test plan for a payments API: POST /payments with an idempotency-key header; the service stores the key in Redis, enqueues a settlement task to an external bank API, and later publishes a webhook to Merchant. Include how you&#039;d validate exactly-once writes under 10k concurrent requests, simulate bank timeouts/retries, verify webhook delivery and replay protection, and validate ledger reconciliation across downstream services. Provide concrete test cases and tooling?</title>
