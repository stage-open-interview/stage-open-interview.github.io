  <title>You&#039;re deploying a new Cloud Run service &#039;data-ingest&#039; that processes Pub/Sub messages and writes to Cloud Storage. To meet a strict security policy, restrict egress from Cloud Run to only Pub/Sub and Storage by using a Serverless VPC Access connector and VPC firewall rules. Provide exact steps: create a connector in us-central1, attach it to the service, implement egress allowlist and deny all others, and verify with a network reachability test.
