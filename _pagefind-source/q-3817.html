  <title>Design a multi-tenant, GDPR/GLBA-compliant loan-scoring platform on GCP for a global bank network. Each tenant must have strict data isolation (per-tenant BigQuery datasets, Cloud Storage, and IAM), regional data residency, and per-tenant governance. Propose end-to-end ingestion (Pub/Sub), preprocessing (Dataflow), model training with Vertex AI Experiments, and canary deployments to per-tenant Endpoints. Include a centralized policy engine for data minimization, explainability, drift/fairness thresholds, audit logs via Data Catalog, and cost controls?</title>
