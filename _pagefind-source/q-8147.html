  <title>Design a beginner-friendly concurrent job scheduler for a build system: dozens of compilers produce CPU-bound compilation tasks and test runners (IO-bound) submitted concurrently. Use a bounded global queue and two worker pools (CPU vs IO). Route tasks by type, ensure each task runs exactly once, and implement simple fair sharing to prevent starvation. Provide a minimal test plan for routing, contention, and correctness?</title>
