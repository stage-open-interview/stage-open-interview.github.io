  <title>Context: A Linux host running a data ingestion batch occasionally stalls as the number of open files grows toward the system limit during ETL. Using only default tooling, design a beginner-friendly diagnostic workflow to (1) confirm whether file descriptor exhaustion is the bottleneck versus CPU/IO/memory, (2) identify the process with the most open FDs and the top offending file/socket types, and (3) apply a safe mitigation (e.g., raise limits, tune backlog, adjust file usage) while preserving observability. Include exact commands and expected outputs?</title>
