  <title>Design a beginner-friendly KCA workflow for a managed multi-tenant data lake service where workloads run in isolated Kubernetes namespaces across three clusters (dev, prod, audit) within a single cloud account, each cluster boots from a shared base image, attests to a regional bootstrap, and enrolls a CSR to a central KCA that issues a short-lived client certificate (TTL 600s) bound to a per-tenant SPIFFE ID and a per-environment scope (data-read, data-ingest); include per-environment policy binding, cross-cluster trust anchors, offline revocation, auditing, and a minimal test plan for cross-cluster reattestation latency?</title>
