  <title>You have a 12-microphone array deployed across a distributed call-center room. Each edge device may intermittently drop a mic and lose connectivity to a central fusion node. Design a robust online ICA pipeline that runs partly on-edge and synchronizes with the fusion node when connected. Specify: (i) fault-tolerant whitening that handles missing channels, (ii) adaptive demixing matrices sized to available channels with online updates, (iii) cross-device permutation tracking via short-time envelope correlations, (iv) asynchronous updates and buffering strategy for partial data, (v) evaluation plan using synthetic ground-truth sources and real-world network faults, with latency targets?</title>
