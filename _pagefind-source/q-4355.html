  <title>You maintain an Aurora PostgreSQL cluster serving 100+ tenants in a SaaS product. Data for all tenants lives in the same database but must be strictly isolated in reads; tenants have varying access patterns and analytics needs. Design a solution using PostgreSQL Row-Level Security and tenant_id partitioning, plus AWS tools (Global Database, PITR, cross-region replicas) to meet isolation, sub-second hot-tenant reads, and near real-time analytics for aggregates. Include credential rotation and audit considerations. What is your approach?</title>
