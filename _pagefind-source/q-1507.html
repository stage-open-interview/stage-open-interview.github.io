  <title>In a globally distributed TLS-enabled API for real-time inference, traffic flows from Asia, EU, US behind a global load balancer and regional edge caches. During peak, Asia users see p95 latency spikes while NA remains stable. No code changes allowed. Provide a concrete diagnostic plan to distinguish between (1) TLS handshake/ALPN at edge vs origin, (2) inter-region routing and MTU fragmentation, (3) load balancer ECMP behavior, and (4) CDN edge miss penalties. Include exact commands, data to collect, and initial mitigations to test?</title>
