  <title>Scenario: In a multi-tenant SaaS, a central migration service applies Flyway SQL scripts to dozens of PostgreSQL instances. How would you implement a concrete plan to sign each migration with cosign in CI, publish attestations to a registry, and enforce at runtime that only attested migrations are executed? Include concrete signing commands, attestation storage approach, and a sample enforcement policy (Kyverno/OPA) plus integration steps with Flyway?</title>
