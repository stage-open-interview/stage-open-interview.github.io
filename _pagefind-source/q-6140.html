  <title>In a distributed telemetry fabric using a DNS-based load balancer that round-robins UDP collectors across NA, EU, and APAC, devices intermittently reach different collectors and tail latency increases when peak traffic coincides with a collector outage. No app changes. Provide a concrete diagnostic plan to determine whether (a) DNS TTL caching causes stale mappings, (b) health checks remove backends too aggressively, (c) health-check probe cadence causes false failures, or (d) firewall rewriting DNS responses, with exact commands and data to collect, and propose mitigations that stabilize collector selection?</title>
