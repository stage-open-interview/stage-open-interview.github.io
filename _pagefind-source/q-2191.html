  <title>Design a cross-account CI/CD workflow for a data platform where Snowflake is the analytics warehouse and an AWS-based ETL stack runs in two accounts (prod and analytics). Implement GitOps-style deployment for Snowflake objects and Snowpipe pipelines, while deploying application updates to an EKS cluster. Include drift detection with automatic rollback, canary data tests using synthetic events, least-privilege IAM, and example IaC snippets in Terraform and SnowSQL. How would you structure this end-to-end pipeline and what are the key failure modes and mitigations?</title>
