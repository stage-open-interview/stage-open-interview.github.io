  <title>In kcsa-prod, a multi-tenant data-processing service on Kubernetes uses Gatekeeper for security policies. A policy update enforces non-root execution and removal of hostPath across all namespaces; a subset of tenants experiences deployment delays and intermittent 4xx during upgrades. Provide a concrete diagnostic plan with exact kubectl and gatekeeper commands to identify violating policies, inspect ConstraintTemplates and Constraints, review namespace exemptions, and trace the admission pipeline; propose a zero-downtime rollout with per-tenant allowlists and rollback, and explain how you would validate latency and throughput during rollout?</title>
