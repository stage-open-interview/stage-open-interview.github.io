  <title>You operate nightly ingestion of 30 regional vendor CSV feeds, each with up to 60 columns, some added over time. Data must land in a lakehouse (Iceberg) with per-record lineage and idempotent upserts, while dynamic schema evolution handles new columns. How would you design an end-to-end pipeline that enforces per-record data contracts, buffers late rows (up to 24h), isolates data by region, and validates data quality before load? Include simple monitoring and a concrete MERGE example?</title>
