  <title>CNPA stack: HTTP API writes events to PostgreSQL, publishes to Kafka with event_time metadata, and a downstream analytics service reads from Kafka to produce 5-minute windowed counts. After a release, a dashboard shows both late counts and misaligned windows. Provide a concrete debugging plan to determine if the issue is event-time timestamps, Kafka timestamps, consumer windowing, or clock skew across services, including exact metrics, sampling, and fixes (re-timestamp, watermarking, idempotent sinks) and how you would validate end-to-end correctness?</title>
