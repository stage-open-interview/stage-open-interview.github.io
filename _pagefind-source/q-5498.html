  <title>You&#039;re running a Cloud Run service named data-processor behind a Global HTTP(S) Load Balancer. Implement a cohort-based canary driven by HTTP header X-User-Cohort: A|B. Route Cohort A to v3 at 20% and Cohort B to v2, then after 60 minutes evaluate SLOs and progress to 100% to v3 if p95 latency &lt;= 0.9s and error rate &lt;= 0.2% in both cohorts. Use only Google-native tools. Provide exact steps to build/push v3 to Artifact Registry, create serverless NEGs, configure a URL map with header-based routing, and implement rollback by routing all traffic to v2. Include IAM roles and Secrets usage?</title>
