  <title>Design a simple 3-level MLFQ scheduler for a toy OS. Levels have quantum 4, 8, and 16 ticks; aging promotes waiting tasks to higher levels after a threshold to prevent starvation. Given two processes arriving together—P1 CPU-bound, P2 I/O-bound—describe their scheduling order, how aging affects priorities, and provide a minimal C-like sketch for enqueue, dequeue, and choosing the next task. How would you test fairness?</title>
