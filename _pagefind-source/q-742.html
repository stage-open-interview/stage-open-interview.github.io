  <title>In a DAG with N nodes and M edges, nonnegative edge weights. You maintain shortest-path distances from source S to a fixed set of target nodes {T1,...,Tk}. Edge weights can only decrease over time due to updates. After a batch of updates, you should update only the target distances that can improve, avoiding full re-relaxation. Propose a practical algorithm that lazily propagates decreases using the DAG’s topological order, such that total work across updates is sublinear on average.
