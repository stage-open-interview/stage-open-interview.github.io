  <title>You&#039;re deploying a real-time anomaly detection system for financial transactions using a hybrid model: a fast statistical detector plus a deeper autoencoder. After deployment, you notice an uptick in false positives during major holidays due to seasonal patterns. Design a practical plan to improve robustness: data collection, re-calibration, gating strategy to route events to the appropriate detector, and evaluation metrics including online A/B testing. What changes would you implement and why?</title>
