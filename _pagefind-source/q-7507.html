  <title>You&#039;re evaluating a real-time group chat feature deployed on an edge network (think Cloudflare-style) where rooms scale up to 50k concurrent users across regions. Messages pass through an edge gateway, a WebSocket server, per-room in-memory state, Redis, and a regional outbound proxy. Design a performance-testing plan to validate end-to-end latency, throughput, backpressure handling, and failover under regional outages. Include workload models, metrics, bottleneck hypotheses, and how you would simulate cross‑region variance and channel saturation?</title>
