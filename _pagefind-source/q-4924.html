  <title>In a three-region deployment (US-East, EU-Central, APAC) using a VXLAN EVPN fabric with ECMP across multiple transit providers, a new 24x7 telemetry UDP stream shows persistent tail latency spikes for cross-region traffic while intra-region latency remains low. The underlay is IPsec tunnels with NAT at the edge. No app changes allowed. Provide a concrete diagnostic plan to determine whether (a) inter-region underlay ECMP hashing, (b) EVPN route convergence, (c) IPsec MTU/fragmentation, or (d) NAT stateful translations are responsible, with exact commands and data to collect, and propose a robust mitigation preserving ECMP and telemetry reliability?</title>
