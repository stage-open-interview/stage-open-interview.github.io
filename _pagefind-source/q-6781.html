  <title>Build a streaming NDJSON processor that routes lines by tenant to per-tenant in-order workers. Each tenant has a bounded asyncio.Queue (memory cap in MB). When cap is reached, apply a runtime policy (drop_oldest or drop_newest) that can be swapped without restart. The dispatcher must support hot-swapping routing rules, guarantee per-tenant in-order processing, and provide backpressure to the source. Include a minimal test scaffold with tenants A and B and a policy swap?</title>
