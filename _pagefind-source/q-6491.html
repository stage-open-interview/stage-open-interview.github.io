  <title>Design an end-to-end NLP pipeline to classify user intents and extract entities from real-time, mixed-language messages that often code-switch between English and Spanish, as seen in a global streaming platform&#039;s support chat. Constraints: CPU-only edge inference with &lt;60 ms latency per message, privacy-preserving processing (no user data leaves device unless consented), and a maintainable evaluation suite including cross-language macro-F1, drift detection, and a simple rollback plan. Include architecture, model choices, handling code-switching, and deployment strategy?</title>
