  <title>Instance-based SAT with mixed Horn and parity constraints: Variables A,B,C,D,E,F. Constraints: (A ∧ B) → C; (C ∧ D) → E; A ⊕ D ⊕ F = 1; (B ∧ E) → F. Is there an assignment to A..F that satisfies all constraints? If yes, provide one; then describe how you would build a solver that combines forward-chaining on Horn clauses with Gaussian elimination over GF(2) for parity constraints, including data structures and complexity considerations?</title>
