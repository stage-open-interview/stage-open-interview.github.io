  <title>Context: A streaming feature store for real-time personalization must decide between two deployment models under GDPR/CCPA constraints: (A) cloud-region-centric with EU data replicated to a central US region for global analytics, delivering tail latency 30–70 ms; (B) EU-first on-prem data plane with a lightweight cloud cache for global lookup, targeting 50–120 ms tail latency. Provide a 12–18 month cost model including data residency compliance, data transfer, storage, compute, tooling, outage risk, and a decision rule with sensitivity ranges?</title>
