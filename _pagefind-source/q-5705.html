  <title>You operate a multi‑tenant data processing pipeline that ingests data from public S3 uploads into a central processing bucket in Account A, then processes data in a Lambda/SQS pipeline in Account B, and stores results in a data lake in Account C. Design a security model that prevents data exfiltration, enforces least privilege across accounts, ensures immutable audit logs, and supports incident response. Include: cross‑account IAM trusts, a CMK in a Security account with rotation, S3 bucket policies and encryption, SQS/Lambda permissions, VPC endpoints/PrivateLink, Secrets Manager rotation, and a test plan for no public access or leakage.
