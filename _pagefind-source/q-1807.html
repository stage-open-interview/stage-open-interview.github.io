  <title>On a Linux host running a hot-reload deployment workflow for a critical service, mid-deploy tampering could swap the binary between copy and start, breaking integrity. Design a production-grade binary integrity strategy using Linux IMA with runtime attestation. Include how to sign binaries in CI, a signed binary repository, systemd integration (ExecStartPre), policy placement, rollback tests, and how you&#039;d validate against tampering during deployment?</title>
