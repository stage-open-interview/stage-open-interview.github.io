  <title>A Linux host running GPU-accelerated video processing containers shows intermittent frame latency spikes during peak load, with no obvious CPU/memory/I/O bottlenecks. Without downtime, describe a concrete, real-world diagnostic workflow using only default tools to (1) verify if latency is caused by page cache pressure or Transparent Huge Pages, (2) identify the subsystem or container involved, and (3) apply a safe mitigation (e.g., disable THP on affected NUMA nodes, tune swappiness, or pin tasks) with minimal impact and observable results. Include exact commands and expected outputs?</title>
