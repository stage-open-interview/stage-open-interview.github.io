  <title>You are deploying a 50M-parameter Transformer for real-time inference in Kubernetes with CPU-only nodes. Provide a concrete end-to-end design to meet tail latency p95/p99 of 25 ms under bursts. Cover: input preprocessing and caching, dynamic batching strategy with latency budgets, model optimizations (quantization, pruning, kernel tuning), serving topology with versioned models and canary rollout, and an observability plan with latency validation under load. Include concrete parameter choices and trade-offs?</title>
