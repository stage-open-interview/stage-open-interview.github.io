  <title>Design a real-time anomaly detection pipeline for user login events across multiple regions on GCP. Ingest via Pub/Sub, run a streaming Dataflow (Beam) pipeline computing a rolling per-user risk score using features like IP, device, region, and time of day. Persist features and scores to BigQuery, publish anomalies to a separate Pub/Sub topic, and trigger a Cloud Run remediation service when a threshold is crossed. Consider idempotency, privacy, tracing, and a practical test plan?</title>
