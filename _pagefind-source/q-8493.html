  <title>You&#039;re maintaining a lakehouse (Iceberg) ingesting 100B events daily plus user profiles. A regulatory requirement: when a user revokes consent, past records must be masked or retroactively deleted, while preserving auditable lineage. Design an end-to-end solution that models per-record consent, propagates updates efficiently, supports retroactive masking vs deletion, handles late data, and includes data contracts and testing. Include concrete Iceberg MERGE patterns and lineage validation?</title>
