  <title>Design a two-level, lock-free timer wheel in C for a high-throughput event scheduler across 8 cores. Outer wheel: milliseconds; inner wheel: microseconds. Each timer stores deadline, callback, and linkage. Enqueue uses thread-local slots and atomic stores; tick advances outer wheel, moves due timers to inner wheel for immediate execution, with epoch-based reclamation. Compare latency and jitter vs a heap queue?</title>
