  <title>In a zero-trust backend, an API gateway accepts SAML assertions from partner IdPs and OIDC tokens from internal IdPs to mint per-service JWTs for a service mesh. Describe a concrete plan to: (1) perform SAML-to-JWT mapping and OIDC-to-JWT exchange with minimal latency, (2) enforce tenant-scoped audiences and issuers and rotate JWKS keys, (3) implement revocation using a Redis TTL cache and a short-lived revocation token, (4) bind tokens to a per-device nonce and an mTLS client certificate fingerprint, and (5) detect and mitigate token replay across regions. Include data structures and a minimal code snippet showing issuance and verification?</title>
