  <title>You&#039;re building a React Native app for field technicians that must upload short audio notes recorded in-app while the app is in the background on both Android and iOS. The design should ensure battery and network constraints are respected, handle token refresh, and tolerate app termination. Design a cross-platform background upload pipeline: Android (WorkManager/ForegroundService) and iOS (BGProcessingTask), define data models (AudioNote, UploadState), scheduling constraints, retry strategy, and provide a minimal React hook sketch (useAudioUpload) to enqueue notes, start/stop background tasks, and expose progress?</title>
