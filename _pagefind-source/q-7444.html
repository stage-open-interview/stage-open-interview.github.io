  <title>You model a four-flag policy with states in {T, F, U}. Constraints: (A → B), (B → C), (C → D), and (D → A). Is there an assignment with at least one U such that none of the four constraints evaluates to F? Explain how a simple 3-valued backtracking propagator would verify this and provide one concrete satisfying assignment?</title>
