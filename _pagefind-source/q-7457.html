Each tenant has its own namespace and a dedicated Transit key used to encrypt data at rest. The rotation must occur every 15 minutes without downtime, support rolling re-encryption of existing data using the old then new key, ensure strict tenant isolation, and include validation and rollback checks plus audit requirements.
