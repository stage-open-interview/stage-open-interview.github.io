  <title>Design a streaming scoreboard for a game. Each event is (playerId, delta, ts). Implement a structure that (1) deduplicates events with the same (playerId, ts) within 1 second, (2) updates per-player total scores, and (3) returns the top-K players by score after each event in O(log K). Use a hashtable for scores, a per-player linked list to track recent events, and a min-heap of size K for top players. Provide approach and time bounds?</title>
