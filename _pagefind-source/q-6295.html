  <title>You&#039;re building a multi-tenant telemetry stack for autonomous delivery robots deployed by Instacart-like, Nvidia-like, and Amazon-like customers on Azure. Robots stream telemetry events (position, battery, fault codes) at ~50k-100k events/sec per tenant via IoT Hub to Event Hubs, then into Functions or Spark for enrichment. Design a per-tenant pipeline that delivers sub-200ms fault alerts, strict isolation, exactly-once semantics, cross-region reads, and cost controls. Include data model, windowing, governance, testing, and rollback?</title>
