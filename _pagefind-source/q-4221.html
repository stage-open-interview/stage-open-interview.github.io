  <title>Scenario: In a Consul Connect mesh on Kubernetes, a canary of &#039;payments-frontend&#039; intermittently cannot reach &#039;currency-service&#039; during peak traffic; DNS lookups sometimes succeed but requests fail. Propose a beginner-friendly end-to-end workflow to determine if the issue is DNS resolution (CoreDNS/Consul DNS), service name aliasing/registration in Consul, or the sidecar proxy.
