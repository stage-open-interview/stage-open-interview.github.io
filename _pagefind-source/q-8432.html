  <title>You&#039;re operating a multi-region service mesh with 5k–20k RPS per region and OpenTelemetry traces ingested into a central backend. Ingestion costs are rising due to noisy traces; design a plan to cut trace ingestion by ~60% while preserving SLI fidelity. Include where sampling is applied (client SDK, agent/sidecar, collector), strategies (adaptive sampling, tail-based, per-operation, rate limits), tests to verify, and a rollback path if SLIs degrade?</title>
