  <title>In a directed weighted graph G=(V,E) with nonnegative weights, edges are inserted online in batches of size B. After each batch you must maintain approximate eccentricities ecc(v)=max_u dist(v,u) for all v within a (1+ε) factor. Propose a practical scheme combining (i) a landmark-based distance substructure from a fixed set L (|L|=k), (ii) selective exact updates for nodes affected by the batch, and (iii) a periodic rebuild. Provide preprocessing, per-batch update time, memory, and a comparison to recomputing all-pairs eccentricities from scratch after each batch. Express asymptotics in n=|V|, m=|E|, k, B, ε?</title>
