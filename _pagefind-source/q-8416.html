  <title>Design a Python generator-based function stream_dedup(source, window_seconds) that reads NDJSON-like dicts from an iterator, deduplicates by the &#039;id&#039; field within a sliding window, and yields only the first occurrence per id. Memory must be bounded by the number of ids seen in the window. Do not buffer the whole source; use per-id timestamps and a deque for eviction. Show a small test demonstrating behavior?</title>
