  <title>An 8-microphone array records a live conference with moving speakers and reverberation. Design a practical convolutive ICA pipeline to separate sources. Include: STFT-based mixing, choice between per-bin ICA vs joint diagonalization, permutation alignment across frequency bins, tracking non-stationary mixing, real-time feasibility, and evaluation plan (SDR/SIR, ground truth)?</title>
