  <title>In a factory setting, an 8‑mic array is mounted on a mobile robot navigating among moving machinery noise. Design a real-time online convolutive ICA pipeline that (a) uses STFT framing, (b) models a time‑varying mixing matrix M(t), and (c) decides between per‑bin ICA vs joint diagonalization. Propose how to utilize IMU/pose priors to stabilize permutation and scale across time, handle drift, and meet real-time constraints. Include an evaluation plan with SDR/SIR and task‑specific metrics?</title>
