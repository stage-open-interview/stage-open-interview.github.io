  <title>You&#039;re deploying a privacy-preserving AI rating model for financial support tickets on AWS. Incoming tickets arrive as JSON (up to 10 KB) in S3; design an end-to-end pipeline that uses SageMaker for inference, writes per-ticket audit logs to DynamoDB, encrypts data at rest with SSE-KMS, and supports reliable, rate-limited processing with error handling and drift monitoring. How would you implement this?</title>
