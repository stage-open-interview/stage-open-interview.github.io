  <title>Advanced CNF Certification: In a CNF fleet deployed across three regions with intermittent WAN, design a fault-tolerant provenance and upgrade governance workflow. Requirements: (1) replicate SBOMs and Sigstore signatures to a central verifier using quorum-based replication, (2) per-tenant upgrade gating via OPA/Kyverno that only allows upgrades when a current attestation + SBOM digest exists, (3) partition-safe rollout with local policy persistence and automatic backoff, (4) provide minimal in-namespace tests and commands to validate a single-region upgrade before global rollout. Include data flow and minimal config examples?</title>
