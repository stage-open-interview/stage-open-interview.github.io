  <title>In a GPU shader optimization pass, four IR nodes N1..N4 have states in {True, False, Unknown} represented as {T, F, U}. Constraints: (N1 ∧ N2) → N3, (N3 ∨ N4) → N1, (¬N2) → (N1 ∨ N4). Is there an assignment with at least one Unknown such that none of the constraints evaluates to False? Outline a 3-valued backtracking approach to verify arbitrary such rule sets and give one concrete satisfying assignment?</title>
