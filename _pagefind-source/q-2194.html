  <title>Given a finite Kripke model M = (W, {R_a, R_b}, V) with W = {w1,w2,w3}, agents a,b, and a proposition p with V(p) = {w1,w2}. After a public announcement of p, compute the updated model M|p and determine which worlds satisfy K_a p and K_b p. Then describe a linear-time algorithm using product update and forward closure to handle arbitrary finite models and sequences of announcements, including a small 3-world example to illustrate the steps?</title>
