  <title>Design a data structure called LiveTopK to process a continuous word stream with timestamps. It must support:
- add(word, ts): register an occurrence
- expire(ts): remove all occurrences with timestamp &lt;= ts - W (sliding window)
- topK(k): return the k words with highest frequency in the current window, breaking ties lexicographically

Constraints: window size W seconds; memory O(D) where D is distinct words in window. Use a hashmap for counts, a heap for top-k with lazy updates, and a queue to expire old occurrences. Provide function signatures and a brief implementation sketch. Analyze time and memory trade-offs?</title>
