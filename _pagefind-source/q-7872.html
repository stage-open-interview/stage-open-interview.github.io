  <title>In a beginner KCNA workflow with topics events, users, and audits, implement a TTL-based pruning stage in the consumer: when a key&#039;s latest event is older than 60 seconds, emit a prune signal for that key to a &#039;pruned&#039; topic while preserving per-topic offsets and ensuring at-least-once delivery. Late events up to 10 seconds must still be processed. Describe the data model, TTL bookkeeping, watermark handling, and offset commit strategy, plus a minimal test harness including a canary scenario to verify pruning, reprocessing, and no message loss?</title>
