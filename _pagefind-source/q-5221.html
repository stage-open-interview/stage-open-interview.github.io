  <title>Scenario: A multi-tenant data platform used by advertisers experiences a region-specific schema evolution in the event ingestion path that, due to GDPR consent flags, only affects EU tenants. Design a CAPA program that addresses privacy-by-design while containment and recurrence prevention. Include: 1) a CAPA data model capturing evidence, consent flags, data locality, and audit traces; 2) a tenant-scoped lifecycle state machine for CAPA progression; 3) a minimal REST API to create/update CAPAs with linked logs/traces; 4) privacy-aware metrics (containment time, recurrence by tenant, consent-compliance rate) by region; 5) an RCA template and a canary rollout plan that respects data locality and consent constraints?</title>
