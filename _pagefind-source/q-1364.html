  <title>A Linux host running multiple microservices behind NGINX exhibits intermittent latency spikes; new connections occasionally fail and FD usage appears high. Using only default tools, describe a beginner-friendly workflow to (1) confirm FD exhaustion is the bottleneck, (2) identify the offending process by per‑process FD usage, and (3) apply a safe mitigation (increase NOFILE limits, adjust per-service limits, or set a systemd limit) while monitoring impact. Include exact commands and expected outputs?</title>
