  <title>Design an online nonlinear ICA pipeline for a 12-mic, 6-camera live broadcast where mixing is nonlinear and time-varying due to the environment. Propose an invertible neural network demixing model, online training with forgetting, a temporal prior to capture dynamics, and strategies for permutation/scale alignment. Include evaluation plan and DSP constraints?</title>
