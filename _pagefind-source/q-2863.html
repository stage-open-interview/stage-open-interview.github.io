  <title>Design a two-region, multi-account AWS networking stack for a privacy-focused SaaS. Each tenant has a dedicated VPC attached to a regional Transit Gateway. The new requirement: inter-tenant data-plane traffic should be IPv6-first with IPv4 fallback, while control-plane remains dual-stack. Include on-prem connectivity via a DX Gateway, a central Analytics VPC reachable only through PrivateLink, automatic DR failover for the control-plane, and straightforward tenant onboarding. How would you implement end-to-end?</title>
