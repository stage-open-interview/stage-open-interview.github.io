  <title>You&#039;re building a global privacy-preserving analytics product. Ingest CRM and order data from three regions (customer_id, region, order_id, product_id, amount, timestamp, consent_flag) into a lakehouse (Delta or Iceberg) with per-record lineage and region isolation. Implement dynamic masking policies that evolve over time, ensure GDPR delete propagation, and enforce near real-time dashboards.
