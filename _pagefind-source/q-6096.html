  <title>You&#039;re building a multi-tenant order workflow using Saga + Event Sourcing + CQRS. The process moves through InventoryReserved, PaymentCaptured, and Shipping, and requires compensating actions if Shipping fails. Describe your chosen saga style (orchestration vs choreography), how you route per-tenant events, how to guarantee idempotence and at-least-once delivery, and how you model per-tenant compensation data. Include a concrete data model for the events and a minimal orchestrator snippet that reacts to InventoryReserved and issues PaymentCapture; explain how failure triggers ShippingFailure compensation?</title>
