  <title>You&#039;re migrating a Cloud Run service named invoice-processor behind a Global HTTP(S) Load Balancer. Implement a nightly, automated promotion from v1 to v2 using only Google-native tools: build and push the v2 image to Artifact Registry, deploy v2 with a 5% canary for 30 minutes, run a lightweight test suite and latency checks, and promote to 100% if tests pass and p95 latency &lt;= 0.6s with error rate &lt; 0.1%; otherwise rollback to v1 by routing all traffic back. Include exact gcloud steps, per-revision traffic split, monitoring alerts, and minimal IAM permissions?</title>
