  <title>Scenario: A Linux host with two CPU sockets runs several containerized services. Under sustained load, tail latency spikes for one service despite normal CPU and I/O metrics. Using only default tools, design a concrete diagnostic workflow to (1) confirm NUMA-related memory access latency as the cause, (2) identify the offending NUMA node(s) and memory policy, and (3) apply a safe mitigation (e.g., bind the culprit process/container to its local NUMA node with numactl, adjust memory policy, or move the container) while preserving observability. Include exact commands and example outputs?</title>
