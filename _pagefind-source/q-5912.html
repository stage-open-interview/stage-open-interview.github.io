  <title>Design a KCA workflow for a multi-tenant, serverless edge compute platform where each function invocation runs in an ephemeral sandbox on edge nodes and must establish mutual TLS to internal services. Functions boot with a software root plus optional hardware-backed attestation, attest to a regional bootstrap service, and enroll a CSR to a central KCA that issues a short-lived client certificate (TTL 300s) bound to a per-tenant SPIFFE ID and a &#039;serverless-func&#039; scope. Include per-tenant policy bindings, cross-region trust anchors, crypto agility plan, online/offline revocation, auditing, and a test plan focusing on cold-start latency, function isolation, and certificate reuse across bursts?</title>
