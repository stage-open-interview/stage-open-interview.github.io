  <title>You&#039;re deploying a Transformer-based sequence model for a real-time recommender in TensorFlow Serving behind a microservice API. Clients send requests with variable-length sequences up to 1024 tokens. You need dynamic batching, mixed precision, and memory-efficient attention to meet P95 latency under 30 ms at 1k RPS, plus canary rollouts. Outline the end-to-end approach: preprocessing, model packaging, dynamic batching strategy, memory management, and benchmarking. Which TF APIs and Serving config would you use, and what are the trade-offs?</title>
