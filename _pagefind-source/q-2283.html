  <title>You have a small image classifier trained in Keras on 28x28 grayscale images and you need to deploy on-device with limited compute. Describe a concrete, end-to-end plan to convert the model to TensorFlow Lite, choose between post-training quantization and quantization-aware training, and how you would validate that accuracy loss on-device remains acceptable after quantization?</title>
