  <title>Design a KCA workflow for a multi-tenant, 5G-connected edge IoT mesh where devices boot with a TPM-backed root, attest to a regional bootstrap service, and enroll a CSR to a central KCA that issues short-lived client certificates (TTL 360s) using a PQC algorithm (e.g., XMSS) with a plan to rotate to classical/different PQC in the future. Include per-tenant SPIFFE IDs, cross-region trust anchors, crypto agility, offline root fallback, revocation via OCSP/CRLs, auditing, and a test plan focusing on churn, reattachment, and PQC handshake performance?</title>
