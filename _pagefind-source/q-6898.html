  <title>In Vault Enterprise, a multi-tenant deployment uses per-tenant namespaces and AppRole-based credentials to access a dedicated PostgreSQL secret engine per tenant. With a global DR region enabled via Performance Replication, design a tenant-aware, zero-downtime failover strategy that promotes the DR replica to primary, preserves lease states, and ensures policy isolation holds during and after failover.
