  <title>Scenario: A Linux server hosting several containerized services suffers intermittent network latency spikes during bursts. The system shows high soft IRQ load on various CPUs. Using only default tools, design a concrete diagnostic workflow to (1) confirm IRQ/NET-related latency, (2) identify the offending NIC or interrupt vector, and (3) apply a safe mitigation (e.g., isolate IRQs to dedicated CPUs, adjust affinity, disable irqbalance) while preserving observability. Include exact commands and example outputs?</title>
