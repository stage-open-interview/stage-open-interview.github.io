  <title>In a multi-tenant CNF-based firewall deployed across four regional clusters, design an end-to-end provenance workflow that (1) signs CNF images with Cosign using a region-scoped KMS key, (2) attaches a tenant-bound SPDX SBOM and a site-binding annotation, (3) enforces via a Kyverno policy that both the signature and SBOM exist and that the tenant annotation matches, and (4) supports automated cross-region key rotation and revocation. Include a one-namespace test plan and minimal config snippets?</title>
