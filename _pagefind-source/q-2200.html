  <title>Beginner ICA with reference signal: A 3-mic array records two overlapping speakers in a small classroom with moderate reverberation. Design a lightweight semi-supervised ICA pipeline that uses a short reference sample from the target speaker to bias the demixing toward extracting that voice. Include whitening, online 2×2 demixing, reference-guided permutation, robustness to time-varying noise, latency &lt; 100 ms, and an evaluation plan with ground-truth SDR/SIR and listening checks?</title>
