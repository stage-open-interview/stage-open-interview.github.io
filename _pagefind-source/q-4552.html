  <title>Design a CKNE-aware shared feature store serving multiple ML models across tenants. Each tenant has CKNE 0–1. Explain mapping CKNE to per-tenant feature-cache budgets, prefetch depth, and TTLs. Propose a minute-by-minute degradation loop that throttles low-CKNE tenants by reducing prefetch depth and cache residency, while rebinding capacity to high-CKNE tenants, ensuring SLA, fairness, and safe preemption rules. Include telemetry, a minimal payload example, and a test plan?</title>
