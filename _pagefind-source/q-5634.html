  <title>Advanced complexity-analysis: You maintain a directed graph G=(V,E) with n=|V|, m=|E|. Edges are online-inserted in batches of size B (no deletions). After each batch you must answer whether there exists a path from any source in S to any target in T, where |S|=|T|=k. Propose a practical incremental reachability structure that (i) preprocesses efficiently, (ii) updates amortized per batch, (iii) answers reachability queries in O(1) time, (iv) uses near-linear space, (v) includes two optimizations, and (vi) compares to recomputing transitive closure after every batch. Provide asymptotics in terms of n,m,k,B?</title>
