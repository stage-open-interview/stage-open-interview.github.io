  <title>Design an asynchronous Python module that ingests NDJSON lines from an async HTTP stream, validates each line with a Pydantic model, and batches events by user_id into micro-batches of at most N lines or T seconds. For each user flush, compute the 95th percentile of amount within the batch and emit to a backpressured sink via asyncio.Queue. Enforce per-user in-order processing, a bounded memory footprint, and a watermark to drop events older than 5 minutes; provide a concise test plan with out-of-order events and slow sinks?</title>
