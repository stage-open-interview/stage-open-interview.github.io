  <title>CNPA stack in production spans two regions (us-east-1 and eu-west-1). A CNPA API writes to PostgreSQL in the primary region, which asynchronously replicates to read replicas and to a Kafka topic for downstream consumers. A BI dashboard across regions shows inconsistent cohort counts after deployments. Describe a concrete debugging plan to determine whether drift is due to replication lag, cross-region consistency, Kafka sinks, or data pipeline caching, including exact metrics to collect, sampling strategy, and concrete fixes (synchronous commit for critical writes, cross-region reads, idempotent sinks, cache invalidation). How would you verify impact?</title>
