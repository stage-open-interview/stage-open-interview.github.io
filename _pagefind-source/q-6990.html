  <title>Advanced: You run a multi-region data lake for telemetry from edge devices. Data arrives as JSON with evolving schema, occasional late data, and strict per-tenant access. Design an end-to-end pipeline using S3 with Apache Iceberg, Glue catalog, and Athena across accounts; include schema evolution, deduplication, data quality checks, cross-region replication, and auditing. How would you ensure low-latency analytics and governance under cost constraints?</title>
