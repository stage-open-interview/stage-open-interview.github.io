  <title>On a dual-socket NUMA server with persistent memory (PMEM), design a crash-consistent, lock-free ring buffer that supports multiple producers and a single consumer. Data is written to PMEM and a compact in-memory log captures operations for recovery after power loss. Include slot layout, enqueue/dequeue steps, memory ordering, and a recovery protocol, plus a microbenchmark plan to verify throughput and durability under power interruption?</title>
