  <title>Suppose a streaming analytics pipeline ingests 10k new vectors daily, each with 180 features, and PCA was computed on historical data. Describe an end-to-end approach to decide when to refresh the PCA vs keep the existing basis, how to measure component drift, how to align new loadings with the old basis, how to handle missing values in streaming data, and how to validate downstream models after dimensionality reduction?</title>
