  <title>Scenario: A new serverless API (API Gateway + Lambda) reads user data from a private RDS instance and writes results to an S3 bucket in the same account. Design a beginner‑friendly security baseline that minimizes blast radius and ensures auditability. Include: (1) a Lambda role with least privileges to RDS and S3, (2) private API access via VPC endpoints or PrivateLink, (3) Secrets Manager for DB credentials with rotation, (4) RDS encryption with a CMK and rotation, (5) immutable logging via CloudTrail, Config, and GuardDuty, and (6) a test plan to verify no public endpoints and no over‑broad IAM permissions. Explain the steps you would take?</title>
