  <title>Design a cost-aware, latency-bounded inference workflow for a multilingual fraud-detection model deployed on Vertex AI Endpoints. Include end-to-end setup using Vertex AI Endpoints, Feature Store, Dataflow, BigQuery, and Data Catalog. Address canary rollout and traffic shaping to meet P95 latency under 180 ms across languages, online feature refreshing, autoscaling and dynamic batching, continuous evaluation with rollback thresholds, explainability, privacy controls, and end-to-end auditability?</title>
