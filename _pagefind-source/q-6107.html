  <title>In a mid-size Azure tenant hosting a web app (App Service) and a background worker, with Cosmos DB and Azure Storage as data stores, design a defense‑in‑depth guardrail to prevent lateral movement and data exfiltration if an identity is compromised. Include how you would use ephemeral workload identities via Managed Identities and Azure AD Privileged Identity Management Just‑In‑Time, network segmentation with Private Endpoints and NSGs, and automated containment/rollback with Defender for Cloud and Azure Sentinel. Also outline a rollback strategy and rollout plan across regions?</title>
