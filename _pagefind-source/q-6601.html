  <title>Scenario: A new microservice accepts user image uploads via a web form. Uploads go to S3 bucket &#039;app-uploads&#039;, an event-triggered Lambda creates a 200x200 thumbnail in &#039;app-thumbs&#039;, and CloudFront serves thumbnails publicly. Provide the minimal IAM roles and policies for the Lambda (least privilege to read from uploads and write to thumbs), the S3 event configuration, and a simple retry/backoff strategy for transient failures?</title>
