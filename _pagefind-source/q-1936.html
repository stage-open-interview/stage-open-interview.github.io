  <title>Real-time 4‑mic ICA in a browser: use a 32 ms sliding window at 48 kHz with 50% overlap. Whitening via incremental PCA on 4 channels to produce uncorrelated components. Learn a 4×2 demixing matrix W with online gradient on y = W x using a tanh nonlinearity; adapt the learning rate to keep total latency under 60 ms. Resolve permutation by tracking envelope correlations frame-to-frame and reordering by energy; test with synthetic overlapping voices plus noise and report SDR/SIR?</title>
