  <title>You&#039;re building a streaming feature store for real-time ML in a SaaS platform. Ingest 200k events/sec from 5 modules with nested fields. Requirements: per-record lineage to a catalog, idempotent upserts into Iceberg, dynamic schema evolution, late data tolerance up to 2 minutes, and CI-driven data contracts with PII masking. How would you design end-to-end, including data contracts, governance, and a choice between Spark vs Flink for streaming?</title>
