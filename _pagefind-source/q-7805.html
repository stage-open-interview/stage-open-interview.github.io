  <title>Build a real-time per-user join between two streams. Stream A emits (user_id, tsA) and Stream B emits (user_id, tsB, amount). A bounded inbound queue feeds M workers that output joined records when both sides have arrived within a 60s watermark. Must preserve per-user in-order emission, handle late data with a policy, and support dynamic worker resizing with backpressure?</title>
