  <title>In a real-time event ingestion path for a multi-tenant analytics platform, producers publish per-topic events into a bounded global ring buffer. A pool of workers must deliver events in per-topic FIFO order while interleaving topics for throughput; design a bounded, two-level queueing system that guarantees backpressure, avoids starvation, and remains live under bursts. Describe data structures, synchronization (atomics, memory ordering, or locks), failure modes, testing strategy, and show a runnable minimal sketch in C++ that enqueues into a bounded global ring and dispatches per-topic FIFO?</title>
