  <title>You&#039;re processing a real-time web log of user IDs arriving in batches of size B from a universe of M users. After each batch, estimate the total number of distinct users seen so far with 5% relative error at 95% confidence. Propose a practical HyperLogLog-based solution: choose the number of registers s, derive the expected relative error as a function of s, state update time per batch, total memory, and how to adapt when B is large or the user space M grows. Compare to exact counting and mention potential edge cases?</title>
