  <title>In a city-scale IoT deployment for smart buildings, 128 sensors stream heterogeneous, non-stationary signals (temperature, occupancy, vibration) that mix linearly in the cloud. Design a distributed online ICA to recover independent sources in real time, handling missing channels (packet loss), nonstationary mixing, and limited inter-node communication. Include whitening, update rules, drift handling, and an evaluation plan with ground truth?</title>
