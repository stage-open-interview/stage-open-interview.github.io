  <title>Describe a time you owned a cross-functional initiative to reduce a high-friction customer journey under a tight deadline. How did you define ownership, scope a minimal viable change, and secure buy-in from product, design, engineering, and compliance? What concrete actions were taken to ship quickly, how was customer impact measured (e.g., conversion rate, time-to-value) and regressions guarded against, and what was the outcome?</title>
