  <title>Scenario: A 24-mic conference array in a dynamic room experiences moving talkers and highly time-varying reverberation. Propose a real-time online convolutional ICA pipeline that uses a lightweight neural whitening stage to adapt to nonstationarity, and compare per-bin ICA vs joint diagonalization, including cross-bin permutation tracking, dropout resilience, and a robust evaluation plan with ground-truth sources?</title>
