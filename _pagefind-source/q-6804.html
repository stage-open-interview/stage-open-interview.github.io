  <title>You&#039;re evaluating a privacy-preserving cross-tenant analytics feature: a client-side differential privacy (DP) on-device layer that aggregates signals locally and streams only encrypted, anonymized aggregates to a shared data lake to power a joint recommender between partner platforms without exposing raw data. Build a 24-month CBA: device CPU and battery impact, on-device DP overhead, secure-aggregation and encryption costs, data-transfer savings, compliance penalties, governance overhead, and go/no-go criteria; include break-even horizon and worst-case privacy leakage scenarios?</title>
