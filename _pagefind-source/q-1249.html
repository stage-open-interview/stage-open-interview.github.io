  <title>You&#039;re building a real-time risk-scoring system for cross-border payments. Data arrives as numeric features with occasional missing values and a few graph-derived signals, streaming at high velocity. You need an incremental PCA that adapts to non-stationary distributions and yields 40 components. Describe how you would: (a) choose/update the number of components under drift, (b) perform online imputation without data leakage, (c) keep loadings interpretable for dashboards, (d) coordinate PCA updates with downstream models to control drift, and (e) design a robust rollback strategy with governance in production?</title>
