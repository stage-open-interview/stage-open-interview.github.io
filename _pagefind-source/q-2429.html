  <title>You&#039;re deploying an on-device, privacy-preserving content moderation assistant for real-time group chats at Microsoft/Discord scale. It runs a distilled transformer on user devices to flag policy-violating messages, with periodic federated updates to keep the model aligned. Build a 2-year cost-benefit model: device storage and energy, on-device latency, update bandwidth, cloud aggregation costs, regulatory risk penalties, and expected safety/retention uplift. Define break-even horizon and go/no-go criteria; include failure modes and mitigations?</title>
