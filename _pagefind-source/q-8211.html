  <title>In a Google Cloud-based data platform running on GKE with MongoDB Atlas as the datastore, CI/CD pipelines push container images and IaC templates. A secret-management misconfiguration leaks credentials during deployment. Describe a CISSP-aligned, concrete hardening and response plan that includes: least-privilege IAM in Google Cloud and Atlas, ephemeral credentials (Vault or equivalent) with automatic rotation, SBOM generation/verification and artifact signing, reproducible builds, runtime attestation for Kubernetes deployments, SPIFFE/SPIRE identity, policy-as-code (OPA) gates, and cross-cloud auditing. Include tooling choices and validation steps?</title>
