  <title>You manage a Linux server with multiple NVIDIA GPUs in a NUMA system, running containerized ML inference workloads. At peak load, one container shows tail latency spikes due to CPU cache/memory bandwidth contention that plausibly affects PCIe DMA to GPUs. Using only default Linux tools, design a concrete diagnostic workflow to: (1) confirm cache/bandwidth contention on the GPU path, (2) identify the offending container/process/NUMA region, (3) apply a safe mitigation (e.g., NUMA policy changes, isolcpus, memory bandwidth throttling via cgroups/mem policy, or cpuset placement) while preserving observability. Include exact commands and sample outputs?</title>
