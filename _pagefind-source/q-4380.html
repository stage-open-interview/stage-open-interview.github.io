  <title>In kcsa-prod, a Deployment payments-collector behind a Service intermittently serves 503s as readiness probes fail during a config change. Provide a concrete diagnostic plan with exact kubectl commands to inspect pod readiness, probe definitions, events, and health endpoints; propose a zero-downtime rollback and a safe rollout path, and explain how you would verify latency stays under 200 ms during rollout?</title>
