  <title>Scenario: In a multi-region CI/CD supply chain, a corrupted artifact is introduced into Region-1 and Region-3 private registries after a malicious PR, causing builds to pull the bad artifact and deploy a faulty feature with leaked credentials in logs. Design a CAPA program to detect, contain, and prevent recurrence. Include: 1) a CAPA data model with evidence, lineage, and owners; 2) a region-aware lifecycle (detect, contain, remediate, verify) with SLAs; 3) a minimal REST API to create/update CAPAs with logs/traces and policy links; 4) region metrics for containment and recurrence; 5) an RCA template and a canary rollout plan for dependency updates?</title>
