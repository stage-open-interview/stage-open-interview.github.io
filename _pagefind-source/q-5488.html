  <title>You&#039;re launching a batch ingestion pipeline that reads events from a queue, processes them via a streaming worker, and writes results to PostgreSQL. For a 60-minute peak window, design a beginner-friendly performance test to locate bottlenecks. Include a simple load profile, concrete metrics (latency, p95, throughput, queue depth, DB write time), data strategy, and a plan to isolate components (producer, stream processor, sink) without altering business code?</title>
