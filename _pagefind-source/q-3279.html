  <title>Privacy-first cross-tenant data export service on Azure: tenants configure export jobs to move selected telemetry from a central data lake to their own storage destinations (Azure Blob or S3-compatible) in real time or near-real-time. Data ingested through Azure Event Hubs, processed by a chain of Functions and Durable Functions to apply redaction/pseudonymization rules stored per-tenant in Cosmos DB, then written to the destination with per-tenant encryption keys from Key Vault. How would you design end-to-end flow, guarantees (idempotence, exactly-once), security boundaries, data residency, and auditability, including failure handling and SLA targets? Include concrete components and data formats?</title>
