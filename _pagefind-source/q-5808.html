  <title>In a Consul Connect mesh on Kubernetes a gRPC-based pair experiences intermittent 503s during peak load; the issue is suspected to be TLS/mTLS/ALPN through sidecars and mesh gateway. Design a beginner-friendly end-to-end debugging workflow to verify (a) sidecar mTLS identity and CA rotation, (b) Envoy-based gRPC traffic through the mesh gateway, and (c) DNS/service registration consistency. Include concrete commands, config checks, and a rollback plan?</title>
