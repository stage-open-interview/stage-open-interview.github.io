  <title>You&#039;re building a hotel booking backend with CQRS and event sourcing. When a user places a reservation, the Booking service writes a RoomBooked event that a Saga coordinator uses to ReserveRoom in the Availability service. If room reservation fails, the Saga should emit a BookingCancelled and release any partial state. Describe a beginner‑friendly, concrete plan to model events, implement a simple orchestrator, and keep read models eventually consistent. Include a minimal event store schema and a tiny code sketch showing event append and projection?</title>
