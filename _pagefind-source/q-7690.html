  <title>In a campus WAN with central DHCP and two subnets 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24, DHCP clients intermittently fail to obtain addresses during mid-day. No server changes. Provide a concrete diagnostic plan to determine whether (a) relay agent configuration on edge switches is incorrect, (b) DHCP scope exhaustion or exclusions, (c) VLAN/trunk misconfig causing broadcast drops, or (d) DHCP snooping/port-security blocking relay traffic, with exact commands and data to collect, and propose mitigations to restore reliable DHCP service?</title>
