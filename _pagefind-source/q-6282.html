  <title>You&#039;re leading a cross-functional migration of an internal developer platform (IDP) to a centralized, self-serve CI/CD system used by 6 product teams. The migration offers 25% faster delivery but requires a 12-week cutover with phased pilots. Describe the governance, milestones, success metrics, and risk controls you would implement to minimize production risk, align security/compliance, and maintain business cadence. How do you resolve disagreements between teams over feature gatekeeping and platform standardization?</title>
