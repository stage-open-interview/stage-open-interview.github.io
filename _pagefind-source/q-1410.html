  <title>On a Linux host, a data-processing job occasionally stalls during bursts. Using only default tooling and no downtime, outline a concrete, beginner-friendly diagnostic flow to (1) confirm CPU, memory, or I/O bound, (2) identify the offending process and its operation, and (3) apply a safe mitigation (e.g., adjust priority, pause/resume, or throttle) with monitoring. Which commands would you run and what outputs would you expect?</title>
