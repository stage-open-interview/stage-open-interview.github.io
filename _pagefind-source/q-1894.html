  <title>You&#039;re operating a Slack/Anthropic-scale SaaS using Vault for **Kubernetes** workloads. Each namespace gets a dedicated Vault role via the Kubernetes auth method, issuing per-pod credentials with a TTL of 15 minutes. Describe how you would implement scalable rotation and safe renewal to avoid expired secrets, including: (a) agentless vs agent-based rotation strategies, (b) pre-rotation and lease renewal coordination across many pods, (c) handling long-running jobs that outlive their pods, and (d) auditing, revocation on namespace deletion, and potential upgrade paths. Include concrete Vault commands and config snippets?</title>
