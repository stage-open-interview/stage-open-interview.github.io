  <title>Context: A Linux host runs multiple containers on a single NIC behind a load balancer. During a traffic spike, a critical API shows increased latency and occasional 5xx errors. Using only default Linux tools, outline a concrete, practical diagnostic workflow to (1) determine whether latency comes from CPU, memory pressure, disk I/O, or network contention, (2) identify the exact container or process responsible, and (3) apply a safe mitigation (e.g., throttle or move to a different cgroup, adjust IO scheduler) with minimal disruption and full observability. Include exact commands and expected outputs?</title>
