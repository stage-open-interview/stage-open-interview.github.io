  <title>You&#039;re building a region-scoped, multi-tenant cca_score streaming system with regional data residency guarantees for each tenant. The pipeline ingests 15k–60k events/sec from partner feeds, computes per-tenant cca_scores with model_versioning, and must support cross-region dedup, exactly-once semantics, and safe backfill during partitions. Describe end-to-end architecture, data model, and deployment strategy to meet residency, isolation, and rollback guarantees?</title>
