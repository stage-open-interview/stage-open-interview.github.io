  <title>In a production AWS ML pipeline, you must serve multiple fraud-detection models across two regions using a SageMaker Multi-Model Endpoint (MME). Propose a concrete deployment and autoscaling strategy that keeps p95 latency under 200 ms during peak, prevents cold starts, and optimizes memory by loading only active models. Describe per-model versioning with SageMaker Model Registry, traffic routing, canary validation, rollback triggers, cost implications, and cross-region consistency?</title>
