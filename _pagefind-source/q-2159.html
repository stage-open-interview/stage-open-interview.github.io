  <title>Scenario: In a weighted directed graph with nonnegative weights, you must maintain approximate betweenness centrality for all nodes under batches of edge insertions of size B. Propose a concrete, implementable scheme that (i) initializes estimates, (ii) updates after each batch with amortized cost, (iii) bounds memory, and (iv) provides guaranteed error bounds ε. Include two practical optimizations and compare to re-running Brandes&#039; algorithm after every batch?</title>
