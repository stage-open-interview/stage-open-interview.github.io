  <title>Scenario: Ingest IoT JSON logs stored in ADLS Gen2 under /iot/logs/ into a clean, queryable table in Azure Synapse. The schema evolves as new fields are added over time. Design a beginner-friendly pipeline using Synapse Pipelines or Data Factory that: 1) handles schema drift, 2) writes normalized data to Parquet in /processed/iot/, 3) loads incrementally via watermark strategy into a small fact table (device_id, event_date, event_type, duration), and 4) logs data quality metrics and lineage. Which services and steps would you implement, and how would you validate success?</title>
