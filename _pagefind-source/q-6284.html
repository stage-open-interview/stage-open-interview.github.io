  <title>In a Consul Connect mesh on Kubernetes, a new &#039;webhook-service&#039; has a health check that calls an external API; after deployment, the service appears healthy locally but the health check fails in Consul. Outline a beginner-friendly end-to-end debugging workflow to determine whether the failure is caused by (a) the health check&#039;s external URL/network egress from the sidecar, (b) the sidecar&#039;s outbound traffic policy, or (c) the mesh gateway egress proxy. Include concrete commands, config checks, and rollback steps?</title>
