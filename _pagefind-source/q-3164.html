  <title>Design an inference path for a Transformer-based model served via TensorFlow Serving behind a REST API where input sequences vary in length from 1 to 1024 tokens. To meet bounded latency under burst traffic, describe how you would implement dynamic batching with a fixed window, sequence-length bucketing, and a warm cache. Include concrete parameters and where the logic lives (serving config vs client)?</title>
