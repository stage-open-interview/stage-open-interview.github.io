  <title>In a 5-mic array mounted on a warehouse robot, three humans speak while forklift noise fluctuates with movement. Propose a beginner ICA pipeline that uses a single-stage online whitening and a fixed 3×3 demixer updated every 100 ms, with a 2D spatial smoothing pre-process to resolve closely spaced sources.
