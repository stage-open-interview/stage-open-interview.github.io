  <title>You&#039;re running a multi-tenant analytics store with per-tenant shards across regions. When a tenant&#039;s write load spikes and a shard becomes hot, design an online sharding strategy that repartitions with near-zero downtime, preserves per-tenant isolation, and defines replication topology and migration steps. How would you implement hot-shard detection, online split, and read-after-write consistency during migration?</title>
