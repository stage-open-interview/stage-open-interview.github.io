  <title>On a workstation with 4 GPUs, train a multi-modal model (image + text) using a shared backbone and two heads. How would you implement a single training loop that (1) accumulates gradients to emulate a larger global batch, (2) applies per-branch loss weights to form a stable total loss under mixed-precision, and (3) keeps data sharding synchronized across GPUs? Provide a minimal code sketch?</title>
