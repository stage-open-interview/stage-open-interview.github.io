  <title>Design a multi-tenant, privacy-preserving online inference and feature materialization pipeline on GCP for a cross-region ride-hailing platform. Each tenant has its own feature schema and data residency needs. Outline how you would manage per-tenant Feature Store namespaces, Canary deployments across tenants, live vs. batch feature materialization, drift/bias monitoring, provenance, and automated rollback with Vertex AI Endpoints, Dataflow, and Pub/Sub. Include concrete rollback criteria and cost considerations?</title>
