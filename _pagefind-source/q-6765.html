  <title>You manage a distributed service with four flags A, B, C, D in {Up, Down, Unknown}. Constraints: (A ∧ B) → C; (B ∨ D) → A; (¬D) → (A ∨ C). Is there an assignment with exactly one Unknown such that none of the constraints evaluates to Down under Kleene 3-valued semantics (Up &gt; Unknown &gt; Down)? Provide a depth-3 backtracking trace and a concrete satisfying assignment?</title>
