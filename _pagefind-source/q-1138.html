  <title>You are building a real-time KCNA feed service used by Snap, Meta, and Discord-scale clients to publish and deliver announcements across regions with sub-100ms tail latency. Describe the end-to-end architecture, data model for Announcement, ingestion and delivery pipeline, guarantees (at-least-once vs exactly-once), ordering, deduplication, failover, tests, and observability. How would you scale to 10k updates/sec with 99.999% uptime?</title>
