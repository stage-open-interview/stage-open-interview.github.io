  <title>Scenario: A Terraform repo uses a single module &#039;web&#039; that provisions an ALB-backed service in two environments, blue and green, each as its own Terraform workspace. Blue is live; you need to deploy a non-breaking upgrade to green, validate it in isolation, then switch production traffic via Route53 with minimal downtime. Describe exact steps to provision green in parallel, run drift checks, promote green by updating the DNS record, and roll back if issues arise, including the precise addresses to target and commands for workspace, plan, apply, and state moves?</title>
