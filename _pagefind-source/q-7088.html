  <title>In a toy OS kernel, two threads contend for a single device using a FIFO ticket lock paired with a per-thread wait queue. Describe end-to-end how acquire and release work, how a thread blocks, and how wakeups wake the next waiter. Provide a minimal C-like sketch for the data structures and the acquire/release paths, including how to avoid deadlock and minimize spinning under contention. Include how you would test for fairness?</title>
