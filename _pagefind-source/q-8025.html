  <title>Design an intermediate Azure OpenAI-powered knowledge assistant for a regulated field services team that must satisfy data residency, privacy, and auditability. It runs behind API Management and grounds answers against a versioned KB stored in Azure Blob via Cognitive Search. Requirements: (a) redact PII/secrets in prompts and responses, (b) enforce per-tenant data residency by routing to region-specific OpenAI endpoints via Private Link, (c) log prompts, responses, and token usage to Data Lake with retention controls, (d) outline end-to-end data flow, architecture, and a minimal test plan?</title>
