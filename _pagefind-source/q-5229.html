  <title>You&#039;re evaluating a privacy-preserving on-device analytics SDK that lets apps collect events, compute coarse-grained aggregates locally (e.g., histograms, counts) using CRDTs, and periodically syncs only encrypted aggregates to a central server for product insights. Build an 18-month CBA: local storage per user, CPU cycles for aggregation, energy impact, encryption/sync overhead, privacy/regulatory costs, and expected business impact (decision quality, dashboard accuracy, revenue uplift); include go/no-go criteria and break-even horizon?</title>
