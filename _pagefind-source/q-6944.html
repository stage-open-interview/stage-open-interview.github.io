  <title>In a backend system with microservices, implement a Notification service using event-sourcing and a simple CQRS read model. The service subscribes to events: OrderCreated, OrderCancelled, PaymentFailed, InventoryLow and updates a per-user notification feed. Describe your event schema, how you build the read model by replaying events, and how you achieve idempotent processing and deduplication across at-least-once delivery. Include sample event definitions and a minimal code sketch showing event handler, replay, and a read model projection?</title>
