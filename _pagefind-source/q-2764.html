  <title>In a globally distributed API deployed across two regions, inter-region latency spikes occur for a subset of traffic while intra-region latency remains low. The underlay uses an EVPN/VXLAN fabric with multiple interconnects and ECMP across them. You suspect per-flow ECMP hash collisions cause path oscillation and cache misses. Without changing app code, outline a concrete diagnostic plan to confirm the cause and propose mitigations that preserve ECMP while stabilizing inter-region paths?</title>
