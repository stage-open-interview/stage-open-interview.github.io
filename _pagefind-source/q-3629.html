  <title>In a directed graph with N nodes and M edges, edges arrive online in batches of size B. After each batch, estimate, with high probability, the number of nodes reachable from a fixed set S within at most D hops, within a (1±ε) factor. Propose a streaming sampling scheme: (i) pick k random walks of length D starting from S or uniformly; (ii) specify update rules per batch; (iii) derive variance/error bounds and how to set k for a target failure prob; (iv) amortized time and memory; (v) compare to rerunning a bounded-depth multi-source BFS after each batch. Provide asymptotics in n,m,k,B,ε,D?</title>
