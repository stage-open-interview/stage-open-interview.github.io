  <title>Context: A multi-tenant ride-hailing platform runs AI inference in a shared GPU-backed service. Data and models are tenant-scoped, but cross-tenant leakage could occur via microarchitectural side channels. Design a production-grade isolation plan using confidential computing (AWS Nitro Enclaves or equivalent) with per-tenant attestation, envelope encryption, and strict data-path controls. Describe boundary design, key provisioning, tenant onboarding, monitoring, and an IR playbook with measurable success criteria; include concrete steps and trade-offs. How would you validate the plan before production?</title>
