  <title>On a Linux host delivering real-time API responses, tail latency spikes during bursts even though overall CPU and network usage look reasonable. Using only default tooling, design a concrete diagnostic workflow to (1) determine if stalls are caused by IRQ/NAPI imbalance or driver contention, (2) identify the exact NIC IRQ lines and CPU cores involved, and (3) implement a safe mitigation (e.g., pin IRQs to specific CPUs, toggle NIC offloads, or adjust irqbalance) while preserving observability. Include exact commands and example outputs?</title>
