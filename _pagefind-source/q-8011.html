  <title>In a two-region deployment with DNS-based steering between EU and US regions, a cross-region telemetry endpoint shows intermittent tail latency spikes during business hours. No app changes. Provide a concrete diagnostic plan to determine whether (a) DNS steering misconfiguration, (b) TTL handling, (c) health-check reporting delays, or (d) regional egress path issues are to blame, with exact commands and data to collect, and propose mitigations that preserve latency stability?</title>
