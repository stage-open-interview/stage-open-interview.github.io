  <title>In a React admin dashboard used across a large org, implement a FeatureRolloutPanel that renders 1000 feature-flag cards coming from a Redux-backed WebSocket stream. The panel should filter by environment (prod/staging) and user role, render with virtualization, and apply burst updates safely. Describe architecture, selectors, and rendering strategy; provide code sketches for a memoized selector bucketed by environment/role, a React.memo FlagCard, and integration with useTransition for rapid toggles?</title>
