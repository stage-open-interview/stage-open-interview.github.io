  <title>Design an end-to-end test for a Discord-like chat app with channel-level feature flags that toggle moderation and reactions. The app runs in three regions, with a central presence service. Include: data seeding for tenants and channels; simulating 1000 concurrent users joining a channel; gradual flag rollout (A -&gt; B -&gt; C) and rollback; verify per-channel reaction counts reflect the flag state and messages adhere to moderation rules; ensure strict data isolation between tenants and validate observability/tracing?</title>
