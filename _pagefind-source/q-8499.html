  <title>Design a beginner-friendly concurrent event queue for a real-time analytics system: hundreds of producers push events tagged with a priority (high, normal, low) into a bounded global queue. Implement a simple scheduler that always serves high-priority events first, but guarantees aging so normal and low-priority events are not starved (e.g., promotion after a fixed wait). Use a small worker pool to process events and measure throughput and latency. Provide a concrete implementation approach in Go or Python asyncio and a test plan?</title>
