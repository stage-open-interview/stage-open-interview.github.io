  <title>You operate a fleet of industrial IoT sensors emitting events at high throughput. Design a real-time ingestion and processing pipeline on GCP using Pub/Sub, Dataflow, and BigQuery. Requirements: ingest at scale, compute an anomaly score in streaming, write idempotent results to BigQuery, alert on breaches via Cloud Monitoring, and handle late data with a dead-letter path. Explain exactly-once semantics, retry/backoff, and a test plan with synthetic data including duplicates?</title>
