  <title>Design a KCA workflow for a multi-tenant edge CDN that deploys ephemeral edge workers across six regions. Each worker boots with a hardware-backed root, attests to a regional bootstrap service, and enrolls a CSR to a central KCA issuing a short-lived TLS certificate (TTL 120s) bound to a per-edge SPIFFE ID and an &#039;edge&#039; scope. Include cross-region trust anchors, policy-driven cert rotation, PQC fallback, revocation, auditing, and a test plan for burst-cache warmups, origin revalidation latency, and regional outage reattestation?</title>
