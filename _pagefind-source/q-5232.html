  <title>In a three-region VXLAN EVPN fabric with ECMP and IPsec inter-region tunnels, cross-region traffic between tenants experiences sporadic 200ms tail latency during peak hours, while intra-region is fine. No app changes. Provide a concrete diagnostic plan to determine whether (a) EVPN route convergence, (b) IPsec SA rekey/fragmentation, (c) NAT translation exhaustion, or (d) ECMP hashing on overlay/underlay is to blame, with exact commands and data to collect, and propose robust mitigations preserving isolation and telemetry reliability?</title>
