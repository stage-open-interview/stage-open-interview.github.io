  <title>In Linux, two processes map the same 4 KiB file region with MAP_SHARED. One writer updates eight bytes; a reader loops to read the same region concurrently. Describe end-to-end what happens from the write through the page cache to the reader, including dirty/writeback, cache coherence, and TLB; then propose a minimal synchronization mechanism (e.g., a 4-byte lock or seqlock in the shared mapping) to guarantee a predictable visibility order and discuss tradeoffs?</title>
