  <title>In a streaming data pipeline, multiple producers generate frames and a bounded buffer sits between the producer stage and a consumer stage. Implement a backpressure-enabled producer-consumer pair in JavaScript (Node.js) using an async bounded queue that supports multiple producers and multiple consumers. It must guarantee no data loss, bounded memory, and graceful shutdown. How would you test under varying production/consumption rates?</title>
