  <title>Design an Azure DevOps CI/CD workflow that creates an ephemeral AKS environment per PR using Terraform, deploys via GitOps (Argo CD) from the PR branch, injects per-env secrets from Key Vault and feature flags from App Configuration, and gates promotion with policy approvals. Include PR-time SCA/DAST, drift checks with Log Analytics, auto-teardown on PR close or health failure, and full audit logging. How would you implement this pipeline and what are the main trade-offs?</title>
