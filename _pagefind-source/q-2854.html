In prod, a policy constraint was loosened manually for one project. Describe exact, repeatable steps to detect this drift, identify the impacted project, and fix only that project&#039;s policy using Terraform CLI (init/plan/apply) with a targeted -target, followed by a full plan to verify no drift.
