  <title>Design a compact on-device system to detect and track pedestrians in urban traffic and estimate their 3D pose (6-DoF) from a monocular video feed. Constraints: sub-40 ms per frame on an embedded GPU, a lightweight backbone with self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled video plus a small labeled set, and robustness to occlusion, motion blur, and adverse weather. Describe architecture, data strategy, losses, and evaluation methodology?</title>
