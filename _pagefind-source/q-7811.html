  <title>You&#039;re leading four product squads and a centralized platform squad that owns CI/CD, feature flags, and telemetry. A new regulatory push requires deterministic, auditable deployments across all services within a 24-hour window, with a hard post-release SLA and 99.99% release success. Propose a concrete plan to redesign the release process (governance, ownership, and rituals), specify a capacity split between product and platform work (for example 70/15/15), identify cross-cutting owners (audit traces, rollout pipelines, incident mgmt), and define the metrics, milestones, and a 12-week rollout. Include go/no-go criteria?</title>
