  <title>You&#039;re building a remote collaboration tool used by Discord/ Coinbase where 4 handheld mics on different users capture speech, but network jitter causes asynchronous sampling and occasional packet loss. Design a practical blind source separation pipeline to recover two active speakers in near real-time. Include: (i) synchronization strategy for misaligned frames, (ii) choice between spatially varying whitening and joint diagonalization, (iii) robustness to packet loss and time-varying mixing, (iv) latency targets, and (v) an evaluation plan with SDR/SIR and listener checks?</title>
