  <title>Design an asynchronous Python module that consumes a WebSocket stream of JSON events, validates them with a Pydantic model, partitions by both region and device, batches per partition into micro-batches of at most N lines or T seconds, and computes per-batch events/sec. Emit results to a sink with backpressure. Enforce per-partition in-order processing, a bounded memory footprint, and late-event handling via a watermark (drop events older than watermark). Provide a test plan with simulated late events and slow sinks?</title>
