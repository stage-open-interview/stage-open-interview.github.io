  <title>Advanced Azure OpenAI design: Build an Azure OpenAI-powered PR review assistant for a multi-repo org. It sits behind API Management, grounds answers against a versioned policy catalog stored in Azure Blob and indexed by Cognitive Search. It must enforce per-repo consent gating and RBAC to OpenAI, redact PII/secrets from prompts and logs with Text Analytics and a custom secret-detection pass, and implement a &#039;safe-mode&#039; that only returns remediation steps if a code-generation request is explicitly allowed. Outline end-to-end data path, components, deployment, and a minimal test plan?</title>
