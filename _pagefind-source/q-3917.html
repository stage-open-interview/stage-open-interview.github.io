  <title>Implement a portable spinlock in C using stdatomic.h. Provide acquire() and release() with an exponential backoff strategy for contention. Explain memory ordering choices (memory_order_acquire on acquire and memory_order_release on release), and how you would test correctness with two threads incrementing a shared counter to 1e7. Include a minimal C snippet and a test harness plan?</title>
