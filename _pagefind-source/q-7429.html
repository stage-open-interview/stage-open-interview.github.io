  <title>Implement a lock-free, bounded multi-queue system with two priority rings (high and low). Producers choose ring based on a flag; each ring has N=1&lt;&lt;16 slots, 64-byte payload; per-slot 64-bit sequence counter to avoid ABA. Provide enqueue/dequeue pseudo-code with memory_order_release/acquire and a wrap-around check. Explain how you would measure latency and backpressure under mixed-priority traffic on a 2-socket NUMA server?</title>
