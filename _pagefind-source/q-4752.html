  <title>On a Linux host serving a GPU-accelerated real-time inference pipeline, multiple workloads share a single 2-socket system. Occasional stalls increase tail latency of the critical path under peak load. Design a production plan to guarantee deterministic latency for the critical path. Include hardware topology (NUMA binding), kernel/driver knobs (nohz_full, isolcpus, IRQ affinity), per-workload scheduling (SCHED_DEADLINE with deadlines), cgroups v2 (io.max, memory.min), and a validation plan with synthetic bursts. What exact steps would you take and how would you verify?</title>
