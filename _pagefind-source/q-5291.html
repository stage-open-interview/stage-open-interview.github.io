  <title>In a tiny preemptive OS with per-CPU run queues and a single disk I/O device, describe the end-to-end flow when a thread calls read() on a file not yet in memory. From syscall entry to user-space return, explain blocking, how the I/O request is queued, how the interrupt signals completion, how the waking thread is re-queued and scheduled, and how to avoid starving other ready tasks. Include minimal pseudo-code for the blocking path and the wakeup path?</title>
