  <title>In a production app, the frontend is static on S3/CloudFront and the API runs behind an ALB with an RDS primary in us-east-1. A warm standby exists in us-west-2 via a cross-region RDS read replica and cross-region S3 replication. Design an automated failover plan to switch traffic to the standby within 15 minutes, including Route 53 health checks, DNS failover, RDS promotion, ALB target reconfiguration, CloudFront invalidation, and rollback steps. Include testing steps?</title>
