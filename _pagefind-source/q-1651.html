  <title>Design a KCA onboarding and certificate lifecycle flow for 200 edge API gateways deployed across three data centers, serving both internal microservices and external partners. Each gateway boots with a hardware-backed root and attestation-enabled CSR enrollment, then obtains a 10-minute mTLS client certificate from a regional CA. Include enrollment, region-aware policy propagation via a streaming config service, cross-region trust, certificate renewal, revocation via OCSP/CRLs, offline root fallback, auditing, and a concrete 1-page test plan?</title>
