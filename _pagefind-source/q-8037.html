  <title>Design a beginner-friendly concurrency queue for a real-time chat moderation system: messages arrive concurrently from thousands of chat rooms. A bounded global queue feeds a small worker pool that runs moderation checks. Each chat room&#039;s messages must be processed in order, but messages across rooms may be interleaved. Propose a concrete design (data structures, routing, per-room buffers, backpressure) and outline a practical test plan to verify per-room ordering, room throttling, and graceful shutdown?</title>
