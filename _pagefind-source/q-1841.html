  <title>Design a beginner-friendly Azure-native telemetry pipeline for a fleet of IoT devices used by a mobile app, with EU residency constraints. Ingest device telemetry via Azure IoT Hub, preprocess at the edge with IoT Edge (sampling and filtering), route to Azure Functions for enrichment, and store per-tenant aggregates in Azure SQL with Row-Level Security. Expose dashboards in Power BI; include BYOK with Key Vault, DR planning, and cost levers; keep data in the EU region?</title>
