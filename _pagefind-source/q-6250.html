  <title>You&#039;re maintaining a Terraform repo that provisions an AWS EKS cluster across three accounts (dev, prod, audit) and multiple regions. A new requirement is to replicate cluster state to a central auditing account while keeping environments isolated. Outline a concrete plan for: (1) backend/state layout and cross-account access, (2) using remote_state/data sources to share cluster outputs with the audit repo without coupling, (3) a CI gate that prevents changes that would affect production clusters, and (4) drift detection and safe apply strategy. Include concrete snippets and commands?</title>
