  <title>You&#039;re managing a 5-node Kubernetes control-plane spread across two data centers. A regional outage requires restoring cluster state from backups with minimal downtime. Outline a concrete DR plan covering etcd snapshot cadence and retention, restore sequence for control-plane components, re-pointing etcd endpoints, and post-restore validation and workload failover testing. Include exact etcdctl snapshot/restore commands, kubeadm/kube-apiserver edits, and verification steps?</title>
