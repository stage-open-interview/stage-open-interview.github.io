  <title>In a real-time ride-hailing platform, a microservice validates payment tokens issued by mobile and web clients. Token replay risks exist due to clock drift and token sharing across devices. Propose a concrete, end-to-end replay-attack mitigation: per-device binding, short-lived tokens, nonce/jti checks, hardware-backed signing, strict mTLS, revocation, and a migration plan that avoids service disruption. How would you implement and verify this in production?</title>
