  <title>NUMA-Aware Latency: A Linux host in a multi-tenant analytics cluster shows intermittent 5–20 ms tail latency on a service under sustained I/O. Using only default tooling, design a concrete diagnostic workflow to (1) confirm if latency is caused by remote NUMA memory access, (2) identify the offending process or memory pattern, and (3) apply a safe mitigation such as binding to a local NUMA node or selective interleaving, while preserving observability. Include exact commands and expected outputs?</title>
