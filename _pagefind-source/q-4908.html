  <title>In a 6-mic conference room with two cameras tracking three speakers who move around and generate time-varying reverberation, design a real-time audio-visual ICA pipeline to separate the three speech sources. Your answer should cover: (i) front-end STFT whitening, (ii) an online ICA demixer, (iii) cross-band permutation alignment guided by lip-tracking identities derived from video, (iv) online tracking of time-varying room impulse responses, (v) robustness to video drops and audio dropouts, (vi) latency target (e.g., end-to-end &lt;= 40 ms), (vii) evaluation plan with ground-truth sources and SDR/SIR metrics. Provide architecture, data flow, and failure modes?</title>
