  <title>You model a rolling deployment health graph with five services A–E; each service status is in {Up, Down, Unknown}. Constraints: (A Up ⇒ B Up ∨ C Up), (D Down ⇒ E Down), (E Up ⇒ A Up). Is there an assignment at time t with at least one Unknown such that all constraints remain not definitively false at both t and t+1?
