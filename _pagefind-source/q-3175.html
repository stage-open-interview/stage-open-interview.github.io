  <title>You receive daily JSON event files from three SaaS apps landing in ADLS Gen2 at /raw/events/{saas}/{date}. Each file shape differs slightly. Design a beginner Data Factory pipeline to ingest, normalize to a common schema, and write to Parquet in /processed/events/{date}/. Include: (1) a schema-drift tolerant mapping or inference approach, (2) a simple incremental load using a date watermark, (3) basic data quality checks (not-null on key fields, duplicates), (4) automatic partitioning by date, (5) basic monitoring/logging.
