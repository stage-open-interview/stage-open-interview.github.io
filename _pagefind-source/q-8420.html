  <title>CNF certification: In a multi-tenant CNF gateway platform across on-prem and public cloud, design a runtime attestation workflow that ensures a running CNF instance matches its SBOM and a known-good baseline. Describe (1) a lightweight attestation agent that collects image digest, selected PIDs/modules, and critical config, (2) how to sign and relay attestations via mTLS to a central policy service, (3) how a policy engine enforces SBOM and baseline matches, and (4) a rollback/recovery path if attestation fails. Provide minimal manifest snippets and a test plan for one tenant?</title>
