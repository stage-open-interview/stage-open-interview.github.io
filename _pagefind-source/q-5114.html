  <title>You&#039;re deploying v3 of a Cloud Run API behind a Global HTTP(S) Load Balancer. The upgrade adds a Pub/Sub-driven async workflow and region-specific data handling. Using Google-native tools only, design a staged rollout with per-region traffic splits and an automatic rollback. Provide exact steps to build/push v3 to Artifact Registry, configure a Cloud Deploy rollout with region-scoped traffic, set Cloud Monitoring alerts for latency and error rate, and rollback by shifting all traffic back to v2. Include minimal IAM roles and Secret Manager integration?</title>
