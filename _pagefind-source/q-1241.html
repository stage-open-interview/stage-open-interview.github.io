  <title>Scenario: In a multi-user Unix workspace, /home contains subdirectories per user with various files. Some are large, some are temporary. Provide a robust one-liner (no external dependencies) that lists the five largest regular files under /home (recursively), excluding hidden files and symlinks, printing each as &#039;size&lt;TAB&gt;path&#039; with sizes in human-readable form. Explain how you ensure safety against spaces and newlines in filenames?</title>
