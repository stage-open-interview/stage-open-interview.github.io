  <title>You operate a multi-tenant analytics service on GCP with 50 tenants. 5 GB/day of JSON events arrive via Pub/Sub. Design a beginner-friendly pipeline that ingests events with Dataflow, stores them in a single BigQuery table partitioned by ingestion_date, and includes tenant_id. Enforce per-tenant access using BigQuery authorized views (or per-tenant filters), support additive schema evolution, deduplicate by event_id, handle late data up to 1 hour, and capture end-to-end lineage in Data Catalog. Provide architecture sketch and a minimal test plan?</title>
