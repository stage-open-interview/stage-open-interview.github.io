  <title>In a Vault Enterprise deployment with per-tenant namespaces, tenants fetch application secrets from a per-tenant KV v2 path. Design a tenant-isolated rotation plan for a shared KV secret that powers multiple microservices, ensuring that rotating the secret for one tenant does not impact others, and that rollbacks and audit checks are possible.
