  <title>Scenario: A real-time analytics service ingests event messages with a 32-bit integer key. Events arrive in batches of size B every second, and the system must report the number of distinct keys seen so far (cardinality) with a configurable error ε. Propose a practical streaming algorithm and data structure (no deletions) to maintain an ε-approximate cardinality. After each batch, specify (i) per-element insertion time and total batch time, (ii) space usage, (iii) query time for the current estimate, (iv) two optimizations, and (v) how this compares to re-scanning all seen events after every batch. Use asymptotics in n (seen events), B, and ε?</title>
