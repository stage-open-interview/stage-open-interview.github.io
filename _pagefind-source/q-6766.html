  <title>Design a secure end-to-end workflow for a distributed ML inference platform powering real-time recommendations on a streaming service (Nvidia GPUs, CPU nodes) where model artifacts are loaded from an internal registry. Explain how you would implement model signing, provenance with SBOM, reproducible builds, delta updates, hardware-backed attestation (TPM/HSM), per-node secure runtime (e.g., NVIDIA GPU acceleration), secure updates with rollback, and incident response playbooks. Include concrete technologies and trade-offs?</title>
