  <title>In a Linux host running dozens of worker processes inside containers, build a POSIX-friendly watchdog using only standard UNIX tools to detect any worker that has spent uninterruptible sleep (D state) for more than 60 seconds within a 10-minute window and restart such workers with exponential backoff. Use /proc to derive each worker&#039;s startup command from /proc/$pid/cmdline and /proc/cgroups to avoid system processes?</title>
