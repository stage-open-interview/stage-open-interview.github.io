  <title>Design a beginner-friendly KCA workflow for a hybrid-cloud edge fleet where on-prem KCA anchors meet cloud-based edge nodes across Databricks, Tesla, and Snowflake endpoints. Edge nodes boot with a hardware-backed root, attest to a regional bootstrap service, and enroll a CSR to a central KCA issuing a short-lived client certificate (TTL 900s) bound to a per-tenant SPIFFE ID and a data-science scope. Include cross-cloud trust anchors, policy propagation with 5-minute renewals, offline/online revocation, auditing, and a minimal test plan focusing on offline reattachment and handshake latency?</title>
