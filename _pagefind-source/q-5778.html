  <title>You receive a daily 25GB CSV feed from a partner with columns: user_id, event_time (ISO 8601), product_id, amount; some rows have missing user_id or negative amount, and a new optional column discount may appear over time. Design an end-to-end ingestion pipeline into a lakehouse that performs per-record data contracts, deduplicates by (user_id, event_time), and writes idempotently to a daily partitioned Iceberg table. Handle late arrivals up to 6 hours, implement schema evolution for new columns, and provide basic monitoring and tests. Compare Spark Structured Streaming vs Flink for this workload?</title>
