  <title>Multi-cloud CI/CD compromise: a fintech platform runs services on AWS EKS, GCP GKE, and on‑prem OpenShift. A GitHub Actions runner was compromised, pushing a malicious image that escalates permissions for a service account across clouds. Provide a CISSP-aligned containment and recovery plan: isolate artifacts, rotate credentials, revoke access, enable cross‑cloud audit logs, verify SBOM and image signatures, and run a tabletop to validate runbooks. Which steps and tools would you prioritize and why?</title>
