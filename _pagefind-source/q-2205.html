  <title>CKAD intermediate: A 3-rep StatefulSet named &#039;cache&#039; in namespace &#039;prod&#039; must be upgraded with zero downtime. How would you implement a partitioned, rolling update (one pod at a time) using spec.updateStrategy.RollingUpdate with partition, and set readiness/startup probes plus CPU/memory limits? Also provide a minimal PodDisruptionBudget to keep at least 2 pods healthy during maintenance, and outline validation under load?</title>
