  <title>You&#039;re running a real-time telemetry pipeline on AWS: producers send to Kinesis Data Streams, a Lambda consumer writes to DynamoDB. During event spikes, latency spikes and some records back up. Describe a concrete, end-to-end plan to diagnose and fix, including how you determine shard count, Lambda concurrency, data partitioning, and DynamoDB throughput; also what changes you would roll back if the plan fails?</title>
