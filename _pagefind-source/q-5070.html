  <title>In a global Azure data lake for a food delivery platform, ingest streaming events from Azure Event Hubs into Delta Lake on ADLS Gen2. Design an end-to-end pipeline that handles late data via watermarking, performs schema evolution on nested JSON payloads, and upserts a slowly changing dimension in Synapse. Include data lineage in Purview and cost controls across regions. What components and approach would you choose, and why?</title>
