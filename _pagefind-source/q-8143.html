  <title>Design a beginner-friendly prompt-clarity module for a data-analytics assistant used by Stripe and Snap. Given a prompt like &#039;show revenue by country for last quarter&#039;, build a tiny disambiguation router that (a) detects missing details (quarter, currency, revenue definition), (b) emits up to two clarifying questions, and (c) returns a concrete 2-step plan plus a sample payload after resolution. Include a minimal Python prototype that demonstrates both the clarifying path and the proceed-with-default path?</title>
