  <title>You&#039;re building a beginner AWS-only data ingestion pipeline for ML datasets. CSV files (up to 50 MB) are uploaded to S3. On upload, design an event-driven flow using Lambda to validate headers, detect duplicates by datasetId + timestamp, partition data into a date-based path, trigger a Glue crawler to catalog, and write a manifest JSON to S3 with fields datasetId, fileKey, recordCount, partitionPath, and upsert a DynamoDB index with datasetId, s3Root, lastUpdated. Include IAM, error handling, privacy considerations, and cost?</title>
