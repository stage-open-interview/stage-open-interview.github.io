  <title>kcsa-prod: A service mesh behind Istio mTLS uses SDS-based TLS certs rotated from a central CA. During rotation, TLS handshakes intermittently fail for a subset of pods, causing 503s under load. Provide a concrete diagnostic plan with exact kubectl and istioctl commands to verify SDS propagation, inspect Envoy TLS contexts, confirm certificate chain validity across pods, and implement a zero-downtime canary rollout of the rotation with rollback; include how to validate P95 latency stays under 200 ms during rollout?</title>
