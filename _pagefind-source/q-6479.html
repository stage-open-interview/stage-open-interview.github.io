  <title>In a multi-region streaming platform, a new edge-routing rule causes intermittent traffic blackouts in Regions A and B during peak load, triggering regulatory alerts due to data residency policy violations. Design a CAPA program to address this: 1) a CAPA data model capturing evidence, lineage, owners and policy tags; 2) region-aware lifecycle with gates (detect, contain, remediate, verify) and a rollback option; 3) a minimal REST API to create/update CAPAs with logs/traces and lineage; 4) region residency metrics and recurrence indicators; 5) an RCA template and a canary-based remediation plan for routing changes?</title>
