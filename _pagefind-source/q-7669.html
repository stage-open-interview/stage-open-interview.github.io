  <title>In an Azure tenant hosting an AKS cluster in Region A and a Functions-based API in Region B, both accessing an Azure Cosmos DB with multi-region writes, design an end-to-end security automation to prevent data exfiltration and guarantee safe rollback of deployed changes. Your plan must (1) implement Private Endpoints and service endpoints to isolate data paths, (2) enforce egress controls with NSGs and Azure Firewall Premium including threat intel, (3) gate changes with Azure Policy and CI/CD checks, (4) provide a rollback strategy leveraging canary deployment and automated rollback to last-good config, and (5) include monitoring and alerting. Provide concrete steps and rollout plan?</title>
