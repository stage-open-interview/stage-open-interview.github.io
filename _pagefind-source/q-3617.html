  <title>On a Linux host with many long-running services, write a robust one-liner (no external deps beyond standard UNIX tools) that lists the top 5 processes by number of open file descriptors. Only include processes that started at least 24 hours ago. Output: PID, UID, user, FD count, executable path, and a human-friendly age (e.g., 3d4h)? Must handle unreadable pids and spaces in cmdlines. Use /proc and standard tools?</title>
