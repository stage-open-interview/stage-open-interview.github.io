  <title>In a globally distributed anycast frontend with ECMP across three regional edges, EU clients intermittently exit via NA during peak, causing tail latency spikes in UDP telemetry. Without app changes, design a concrete diagnostic plan to determine whether BGP path selection, inter-provider ECMP, or edge-cache routing is at fault, including exact commands and data to collect.
