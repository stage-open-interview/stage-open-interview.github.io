  <title>In a Linux-like kernel, implement lazy splitting of hugepages for a memory-mapped, file-backed region: when a first write touches a region originally backed by a 2MB hugepage, the kernel should split it into 4KiB pages and preserve correctness across multiple processes mapping the same region. Describe the end-to-end flow from the write fault to the completion of splitting, including how to coordinate with per-page tables, TLB invalidation, and writeback semantics for sharing processes, while keeping latency low under high concurrency?</title>
