  <title>Design a multi-tenant ML feature store ingesting both batch CSVs and streaming Kafka topics into an Iceberg-based lakehouse. Each tenant has strict data contracts, PII masking, and per-tenant isolation. Implement feature versioning, immutable changelogs, and backfill support while preserving lineage for reproducible model training. How would you architect the end-to-end pipeline and governance?</title>
