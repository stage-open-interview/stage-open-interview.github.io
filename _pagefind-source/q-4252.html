  <title>In a single Azure tenant hosting a multi-tenant SaaS API surface exposed via API Management with private endpoints in two regions, design a security hardening plan that enforces per-tenant data isolation, controls bot/abuse traffic, and enables safe rollback of policy changes. Explain how you would implement: (1) tenant-scoped API policies and RBAC, (2) WAF bot protection and rate limiting, (3) Private Endpoint + Private DNS with per-tenant DNS zones, (4) monitoring/incident response with Sentinel and Defender for Cloud, and (5) automated GitOps-based rollback with staged rollout and rollback checks. Include a concrete rollout plan?</title>
