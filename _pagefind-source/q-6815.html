  <title>Design a NUMA-aware, per-worker work-stealing scheduler for a user-space thread pool in C++. Each worker has a local 64-byte-aligned queue; idle workers steal from the least-loaded neighbor using tagged indices to avoid ABA. Provide enqueue, pop, and steal with memory fences; discuss cache locality, false sharing, and fairness. Outline a microbenchmark plan across 2 NUMA nodes with 8 threads?</title>
