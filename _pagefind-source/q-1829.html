  <title>Advanced Azure Fundamentals: Design a cross-region real-time telemetry pipeline for a global IoT fleet (300k events/sec, 5 regions). Ingest with Event Hubs, process with Databricks Structured Streaming, and write to Delta Lake on ADLS Gen2 with exactly-once semantics. Implement geo-replication to a DR region, enforce data residency via Azure Policy and Purview, and ensure idempotent sinks with a tested failover process. What components and trade-offs would you choose, and how would you validate DR?</title>
