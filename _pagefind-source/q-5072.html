  <title>You&#039;re deploying a TensorFlow 2.x image classifier behind TensorFlow Serving with a client-side batcher. The workload is bursty; you must maintain low tail latency while maximizing throughput. Design a micro-batching strategy (max batch size, timeout), describe how to configure dynamic batching in TF Serving to support it, and outline how you would monitor and tune latency vs throughput. Include a minimal client-side pseudo-code for batching using gRPC?</title>
