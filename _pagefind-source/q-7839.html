  <title>Scenario: A shared feature store in a multi-tenant platform begins leaking data between tenants during peak load, corrupting dashboards for Discord, Plaid and Anthropic tenants. Design a CAPA program to detect, contain, and prevent recurrence. Include: 1) a CAPA data model capturing incident_id, tenant_id, data_lineage, masking_config, evidence_logs, root_cause, remediation_actions, and status; 2) a tenant-aware lifecycle state machine; 3) a minimal REST API to create/update CAPAs with linked logs/traces; 4) tenant-scoped metrics (recurrence_rate_by_tenant, MTTR, leakage_false_positives); 5) an RCA template and a canary rollout plan for masking/config changes with rollback and audit trail?</title>
