  <title>CNPA stack: HTTP API writes to PostgreSQL, emits to Kafka, and a Redis-backed read cache. A schema change adds a new optional field to the event payload; rollout under peak load leads to some consumers crashing due to compatibility. Provide a concrete, practical rollout and debugging plan to ensure no data loss or outages, including steps, metrics, and concrete changes (schema registry, backward/forward compatibility tests, dual-write, feature flags, cache invalidation) and how you would verify success?</title>
