  <title>In a real-time analytics pipeline, millions of event streams (streamId) arrive; each stream must be processed in-order, but streams can be processed in parallel. Design a bounded per-stream queueing layer with a shared worker pool. Include backpressure when a queue fills, handling of late/out-of-order events, and graceful recovery after worker failure. Provide a runnable sketch in Go or Rust?</title>
