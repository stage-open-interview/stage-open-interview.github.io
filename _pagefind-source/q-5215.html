  <title>Design a bounded, lock-free work-stealing queue (WSQ) for a fixed thread pool of N workers. Each worker has a local deque; producers push to their own tail; workers pop from their own tail; idle workers steal from other heads. Provide pseudocode for push, pop, steal; discuss ABA avoidance, memory reclamation (hazard pointers or epochs), and cache-line layout to minimize false sharing. Include a concrete stress-validation plan?</title>
