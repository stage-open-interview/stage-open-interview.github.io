  <title>Across a two-region Consul Connect mesh (us-east-1 and eu-west-2), a cross-region call from &#039;reporting-service&#039; (Kubernetes in us-east-1) to &#039;data-warehouse&#039; (VM in eu-west-2) intermittently fails during TLS rotation. Handshakes report &#039;certificate subject mismatch&#039; or &#039;unknown CA&#039;. Design an end-to-end debugging workflow to distinguish issues from (a) WAN certificate propagation and rotation, (b) mesh identity/trust (SPIFFE IDs, gateways), or (c) cross-region ACL/intention changes.
