  <title>Design and implement a per-cgroup aware page cache eviction policy for a shared file-backed cache in a Linux-like kernel. Each cgroup has a memory cap for cached pages; the system must still support read-ahead and multi-thread contention, and must avoid starvation of small cgroups. Describe end-to-end workflow from a cache miss on a process within a cgroup to victim selection and eviction, including per-page state, synchronization, how to account charges, and testing strategy?</title>
