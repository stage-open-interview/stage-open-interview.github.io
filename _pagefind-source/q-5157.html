  <title>Design a monocular 6-DoF pose estimation system for a cluttered manufacturing cell: given a single RGB camera feed of a known set of parts on a workbench, with a small labeled pose dataset per part and a large unlabeled video stream, estimate each part&#039;s 6-DoF pose in real time, handle symmetry and occlusion, and support online few-shot adaptation for new items. Outline architecture, data strategy, losses, online adaptation, and evaluation with timing constraints?</title>
