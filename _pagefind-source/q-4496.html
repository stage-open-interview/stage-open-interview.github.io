  <title>You manage a shared Terraform repo across multiple AWS accounts that provisions many S3 buckets. A strict security policy requires every bucket to have server-side encryption with a KMS key and to block public access, with no exceptions. Propose a concrete, end-to-end approach to enforce this policy at plan and apply time, including: 1) a guardrail mechanism (OPA, custom plan checks, or Terraform validations), 2) how to integrate it into CI/CD with a gate that fails on non‑compliance and reports actionable findings, 3) how you handle exceptions and drift, 4) a minimal code example and pipeline snippet to illustrate your approach?</title>
