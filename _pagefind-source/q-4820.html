  <title>Design an in-memory, shared-hash-map for a high-concurrency database worker pool. Implement an RCU-based read path so reads never block even during hash-table resizing, and writers perform safe updates by replacing a bucket structure and deferring reclamation. Explain grace periods, memory barriers on x86_64, and how to reclaim old nodes without use-after-free. Include a minimal code sketch and a microbenchmark outline?</title>
