  <title>Implement a beginner-friendly kernel concept: a character device that uses a fixed-size ring buffer (16 bytes) for data produced by an ISR and consumed by a user-space process via read(). Explain how to safely write from ISR to the buffer and read from user context, including wraparound, blocking vs non-blocking semantics, and how to avoid data races. Provide a minimal C-like sketch of the ring buffer operations and the read() path?</title>
