  <title>In a Consul Connect mesh spanning AWS, GCP, and on-prem with a common namespace, the new &#039;billing-processor&#039; service intermittently fails to reach &#039;invoice-service&#039; under high load. DNS looks healthy, instances show healthy status, but sidecars drop requests with TLS handshake errors. Design a concrete, end-to-end debugging workflow to distinguish between (a) inter-DC certificate issuance/trust, (b) mesh gateway TLS termination or ACL policies, or (c) cross-DC DNS resolution, including concrete commands, config checks, and rollback steps?</title>
