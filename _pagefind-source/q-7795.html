  <title>Channel: backend/apis Difficulty: advanced Scenario: A Netflix-like platform exposes REST endpoints, a GraphQL facade, and internal gRPC services for catalog, playback, and recommendations. Propose a unified API gateway strategy that derives per-tenant OpenAPI contracts from a single source of truth with versioning and deprecation, stitches REST and gRPC into a cohesive GraphQL schema with efficient data loading, enforces per-tenant quotas and circuit breakers with Redis, and supports contract tests and latency budgets. Include data models and a minimal code snippet showing how a REST route maps to a GraphQL field and how tenants fetch their OpenAPI spec?</title>
