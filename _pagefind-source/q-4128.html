  <title>Design a KCA workflow to migrate a multi-tenant, multi-cloud TLS client certificate system to post-quantum cryptography without disrupting existing clients. Each tenant has a policy for PQC vs classical algorithms; implement dual-stack certificates during migration, algorithm negotiation in TLS handshakes, SPIFFE-based policy binding, cross-cloud trust anchors, renewal, revocation (OCSP/CRLs), auditing, and rollback mechanisms. Include concrete data flows and a 1-page test plan?</title>
