  <title>Design an end-to-end retrieval-augmented generation pipeline for an internal engineering knowledge assistant used by engineers at a large tech company. The system ingests docs, code snippets, and issue tickets; uses three vector stores (docs, code, tickets). Explain chunking per source, embedding models, indexing/refresh cadence, cross-store retrieval with a learned re-ranker, de-duplication and provenance, latency targets (e.g., 300ms retrieval, 2s answer), and outage fallbacks?</title>
