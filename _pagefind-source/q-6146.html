  <title>You&#039;re evaluating a real-time collaborative editor with 4,000 concurrent users across 20 documents, using WebSocket presence and delta syncing. Design a beginner-friendly performance test focusing on presence broadcast latency, delta throughput, and backpressure. Include a simple ramped load, metrics (latency, p95, jitter, delta throughput, reconnection rate), data strategy, and a plan to isolate client, gateway, and presence services without changing core logic?</title>
