  <title>You&#039;re building a React application where certain components need to maintain state that persists across route changes but gets reset when the user closes the tab, while other state should be completely ephemeral. How would you design a state management strategy using localStorage synchronization, custom hooks, and lifecycle management to create different state persistence layers, and what patterns would you use to handle state hydration, serialization edge cases, and potential race conditions?</title>
