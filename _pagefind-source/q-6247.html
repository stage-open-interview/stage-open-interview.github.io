  <title>In a streaming analytics system, dozens of data shards emit aggregation tasks that must be processed within strict latency budgets. Design a bounded, hierarchical queue: a global bounded backlog that feeds per-shard FIFO queues, with a fixed worker pool. Enforce backpressure to producers when full, isolate shards to prevent starvation, and implement a fairness policy (e.g., weighted round-robin or tokens) to allocate processing time fairly across shards. Include a runnable minimal sketch in Rust or C++ showing enqueue and dequeue semantics and a basic test strategy to verify latency and ordering?</title>
