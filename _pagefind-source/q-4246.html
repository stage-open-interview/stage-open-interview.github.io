  <title>Design a policy-driven data masking and lineage system for streaming user data into a data lakehouse. Data arrives from regional sources with PII; implement dynamic masking based on consent and region, propagate masking decisions downstream, and ensure end-to-end lineage and a reproducible testable rollback. Include data contracts, schema evolution, and GDPR delete handling. Compare Spark vs Flink for the streaming leg and outline testing/monitoring?</title>
