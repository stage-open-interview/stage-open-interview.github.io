  <title>Design a LangChain-based agent that uses Autogen-style planning to orchestrate three tools: KnowledgeBase search, REST /metrics API, and Dashboard write-back. The agent must generate an explicit plan graph with preconditions, perform retries with backoff, and timeouts per tool. Describe how you would implement the planning data structures (nodes, edges, constraints) and provide a concrete example plan showing the sequence and fallback paths?</title>
