  <title>Design a beginner-friendly ingestion pipeline for two app sources that emit daily JSON logs into separate S3 prefixes: app1/logs/YYYY/MM/DD/log.json and app2/logs/YYYY/MM/DD/log.json. Create a pipeline to land a unified Parquet dataset in s3://data-lake/cleaned/logs/YYYY/MM/DD/, partitioned by date, using AWS Glue for ETL and cataloging. Include schema evolution handling for new optional fields, deduplication by event_id, basic data quality checks, and a minimal end-to-end test plan. Which steps and services would you choose?</title>
