  <title>Scenario: A tiny policy engine uses four predicates P,Q,R,S ∈ {T, F, U} with Kleene three-valued logic. Constraints: P ∨ Q = T; R ∧ S = F; P → R = T; Q → S = F. Is there an assignment that includes at least one U and that makes all constraints evaluate as required? Explain a simple 3-valued propagation approach to verify arbitrary such rule sets?</title>
