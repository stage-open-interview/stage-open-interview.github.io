  <title>CGOA Binding: Safe Go callback bridge for a C API with user context?

Design a CGOA binding for a C API that registers a callback and emits events from multiple threads. Provide a C header and minimal C implementation, plus a Go binding using CGO that exposes BindEventHandler(handler EventHandler) (unbind func(), error). The wrapper must deliver events to Go safely (via a channel), support multiple concurrent handlers, and clean up on unbind. Include a small Go program that registers two handlers and triggers events concurrently. End with a question mark?</title>
