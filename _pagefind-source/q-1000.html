  <title>A Linux host runs several Docker containers; during peak load, API responses slow and some requests time out. Describe a beginner-friendly, concrete diagnostic workflow to (1) confirm whether host saturation is CPU, memory, or I/O, (2) identify the container most responsible, and (3) apply a safe mitigation (e.g., graceful restart or CPU/memory throttling) while monitoring impact. Include exact commands and expected outputs?</title>
