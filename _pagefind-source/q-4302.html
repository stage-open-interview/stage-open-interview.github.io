  <title>In a real-time model serving pipeline for a high-frequency trading platform, a schema evolution in the feature store causes online scores to be computed with mismatched features across three regions, leading to incorrect risk estimates. Design a CAPA program to address this: 1) a CAPA data model capturing evidence and artifacts, 2) a region-aware lifecycle state machine for CAPA progression, 3) a minimal REST API to create/update CAPAs with logs/traces, 4) region/feature-type metrics to prove containment and avoid recurrence, 5) an RCA template and a canary-based rollback plan for feature changes?</title>
