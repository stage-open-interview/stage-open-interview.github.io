  <title>You&#039;re building a real-time log processor in Python. NDJSON lines arrive via a socket. Each line has timestamp (ISO 8601), service, level (DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR), and message. Implement an async function stream_counts(source, window_seconds) that consumes an async iterator of NDJSON lines, validates with a Pydantic model, and keeps a sliding window of the last window_seconds by timestamp. It should emit every second a dict mapping (service, level) to counts in the window; memory bounded by active groups. Drop lines older than the window; include newer lines even if late arrival?</title>
