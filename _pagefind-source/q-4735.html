  <title>You&#039;re rolling out a new recommendation microservice behind a feature flag in a multi-region e-commerce platform. The service will receive 10k RPS at peak, across two regions, and traffic should ramp from 5% to 50% over 4 hours. Design a beginner-friendly performance test plan to validate latency, error rate, cache-hit ratio, and cross-region consistency while the feature flag shifts traffic. Include load profile, metrics, and a concrete test plan with component isolation?</title>
