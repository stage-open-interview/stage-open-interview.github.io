  <title>Two-region SaaS with strict tenant data residency: tenants assigned to a region cannot write in the other region, but hot tenants require sub-20ms reads globally. OLTP store is Aurora PostgreSQL and needs to support a single writer region with read replicas in the other region. Design a data layer that enforces per-tenant residency, delivers fast reads, and meets RPO 5s and RTO 60s. Include concrete configurations, data partitioning, routing rules, and a rollback plan for residency violations?</title>
