  <title>Scenario: A Terraform repo uses module &quot;network&quot; with for_each over environments (prod, staging) to create AWS subnets. In prod, a subnet was renamed outside Terraform from aws_subnet[&quot;prod_subnet&quot;] to aws_subnet[&quot;prod-private&quot;]. The AWS subnet remains, state holds the old address. Describe exact steps to detect drift, migrate state with terraform state mv and/or import, and a targeted apply to bring prod in line without touching staging. Include the exact addresses to target?</title>
