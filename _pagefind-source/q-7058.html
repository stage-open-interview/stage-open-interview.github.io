  <title>Design a beginner Azure DevOps YAML pipeline to deploy a Python FastAPI API stored in Azure Repos as a Docker image to a single AKS cluster with staging and production promotion. Include: (1) CI steps to run unit tests with pytest and lint, (2) build and push Docker image to Azure Container Registry, (3) per-env secrets from Azure Key Vault, per-env feature flags from Azure App Configuration, (4) production gate with manual approval, (5) post-deploy health checks, auto-rollback on failure, (6) logging to Azure Log Analytics, and (7) a cost-guard that pauses promotion if forecast spend exceeds a configured budget?</title>
