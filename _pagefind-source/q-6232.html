  <title>Design a beginner-friendly test plan for GET /offers that returns per-user fields based on a feature flag (premium_offers) and per-user traits. Validate that when premium_offers is ON the response includes premium fields (premiumDiscount, loyaltyTier) and when OFF those fields are omitted. Ensure 200 for authorized users and 403 for unauthorized. Add caching tests with ETag/Last-Modified and 304s. Simulate two concurrent requests with different user traits to verify isolation. Include tooling suggestions and concrete test cases?</title>
