  <title>In a three-account setup (Security, Shared Data, Application), design an automated breach containment flow triggered by a GuardDuty finding of anomalous EC2 activity in the Application account. The flow should isolate the instance by detaching its ENI, quarantine with a dedicated security group, rotate Secrets Manager tokens, revoke temporary credentials, and disable IAM access keys while preserving forensics. Outline cross account roles, EventBridge rules, SSM Automation steps, and an auditable trail with CloudTrail and Config. Include failure modes and testing plan?</title>
