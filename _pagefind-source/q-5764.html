  <title>You&#039;re building a real-time content recommendation service for a global video conferencing app. Ingest 200k events/sec via Azure Event Hubs, route to tenant-scoped models on Azure ML hosted in AKS, and serve inferences with &lt;100ms latency. Store embeddings in Redis (per-tenant namespace) and metadata in Cosmos DB (PK=tenantId). How would you implement routing, data isolation, drift detection, canary rollouts, and rollback strategies to meet latency and cost goals?</title>
