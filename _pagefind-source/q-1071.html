  <title>You&#039;re deploying a CNF-based API gateway across 2 Kubernetes clusters. A recent upgrade causes a cross-tenant data bleed under load due to a shared in-memory cache. Outline a beginner-friendly, end-to-end plan to fix and roll out safely: (a) reproduce in staging with two tenants and isolated traffic, (b) implement tenant-scoped cache keys and per-tenant isolation checks, (c) add unit/integration tests for isolation, (d) perform blue/green canary rollout with tenant-based traffic splits, (e) observability: per-tenant SLA metrics and automatic rollback if bleed is detected. Include a minimal code snippet for tenant-scoped cache key?</title>
