  <title>Design a beginner Azure DevOps YAML pipeline for a .NET Core API stored in Azure Repos. The pipeline must (1) restore, build, run tests with coverage, and run a lint/format check; (2) publish a build artifact; (3) deploy to Azure App Service with two slots: staging and production; (4) fetch per-slot secrets from Azure Key Vault via Managed Identity and apply slot-specific app settings; (5) run a health check against /health on staging; (6) swap to production only after explicit approval; if health fails or swap fails, rollback by re-swapping or re-deploying staging. Provide the YAML skeleton and gating considerations?</title>
