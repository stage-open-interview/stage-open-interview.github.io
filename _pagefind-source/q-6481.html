  <title>Scenario: A 24-microphone cabin array on an autonomous vehicle records driver, passenger speech, and mechanical noise (engine, HVAC) with nonstationary mixing as drive mode changes. Propose a real-time convolutional ICA pipeline that adapts with a forgetting-factor whitening and online demixing. Discuss: (i) per-bin ICA vs joint diagonalization choice, (ii) cross-band permutation alignment, (iii) channel dropout resilience, (iv) latency target (&lt;100 ms), and (v) a practical evaluation plan with ground-truth speech components and artifacts?</title>
