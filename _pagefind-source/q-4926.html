  <title>You manage two Terraform repos: infra-network (VPC/subnets) and infra-app (ECS). Implement a blue/green deployment across dev, staging, and prod, sharing a VPC but with separate app blue/green services behind distinct target groups and a Route53 weighted record. Describe per-env backends, how to reference network outputs via data sources without coupling, and a promotion gate that switches prod traffic only after a full plan and tests pass. Include a concrete backend sketch and data source usage?</title>
