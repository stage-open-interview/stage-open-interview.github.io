  <title>In a multi-tenant CNF gateway managed by a central control plane, design an end-to-end upgrade workflow that uses per-tenant feature flags and a canary rollout with Istio, while enforcing runtime policy with OPA Gatekeeper and SPIRE-based identity. Include: (a) how CNF versions and flags are modeled in CRDs, (b) traffic splitting and health checks for safe canaries, (c) per-tenant policy evaluation, and (d) drift detection with automatic rollback and observability?</title>
