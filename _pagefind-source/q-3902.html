  <title>In a production, multi-region, multi-cloud Kubernetes deployment delivering a fintech service, a CI/CD runner was compromised and leaked short-lived access tokens and container signing keys stored in a secret store. Outline a CISSP-aligned containment and recovery plan that minimizes blast radius, including immediate credential revocation, automated rotation across AWS and GCP, enforcement of least privilege with dynamic access controls (OPA/ABAC), ephemeral credentials (OIDC), audit/log review, and a validation tabletop before rollout.
