  <title>In a multi-tenant CNF gateway platform on Kubernetes, design a runtime attestation flow that binds image provenance (Cosign-signed + SPDX SBOM) to a boot/launch measurement verified by an in-cluster attestor, with keys stored in an HSM-backed KMS. The policy must 1) only admit pods whose attestation matches the image, 2) evict non-compliant pods, and 3) surface per-tenant audit badges. Include concrete YAML snippets for the attestor deployment, an admission/validation rule, and a one-namespace test manifest to validate in isolation?</title>
