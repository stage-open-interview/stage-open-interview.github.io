  <title>Maintain a directed graph with n nodes; edges are added in online batches of size B (no deletions). After each batch, output the number of nodes reachable from a fixed source S. Propose a practical incremental scheme: (i) a fast local propagation pass, (ii) a periodic full recomputation every T batches, (iii) a lazy rebuild trigger when incremental cost exceeds a threshold. Include preprocessing, amortized update time per batch, memory bounds, two optimizations, and a comparison to re-running DFS from S after every batch?</title>
