  <title>Channel: backend/apis
Difficulty: intermediate
You&#039;re building a multi-tenant API gateway that exposes REST, GraphQL, and gRPC to tenants IBM, Oracle, and Airbnb. Describe a concrete plan to: (1) generate per-tenant OpenAPI contracts from a single source of truth with versioning and deprecation, (2) expose a GraphQL layer that stitches REST and gRPC endpoints into a unified schema with efficient data loading, (3) enforce per-tenant rate limits and circuit breakers with a shared Redis backend, (4) instrument end-to-end tracing with OpenTelemetry and provide tenant-scoped metrics, and (5) validate contracts with contract tests and latency budgets. Include data structures and a minimal code snippet showing how to map REST endpoints to GraphQL fields and how to fetch the per-tenant OpenAPI spec?</title>
