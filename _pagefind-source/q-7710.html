  <title>You&#039;re building a multi-tenant Azure analytics pipeline for IoT telemetry from thousands of devices across regions. Ingest via Azure Event Hubs, process with Spark on Synapse for near-real-time enrichment, store per-tenant data in Delta Lake on ADLS Gen2 with strict isolation, and expose fast queries via Synapse or Cognitive Search. How would you guarantee end-to-end latency &lt;200ms, per-tenant isolation, schema evolution handling, audit trails, and cost control with autoscale? Include testing and rollback plans?</title>
