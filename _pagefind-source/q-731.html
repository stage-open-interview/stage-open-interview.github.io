  <title>You&#039;re given an array A of length n with non-negative integers representing daily story points. You must partition the days into consecutive weeks, each containing 2–7 days. The cost of a week is (sum of that week&#039;s points − W)^2 where W is a fixed target. Return the minimum total cost to cover all days or INF if impossible. Propose a DP with dp[i] as min cost for first i days; dp[i] = min_{k=2..7, i-k&gt;=0} dp[i-k] + (sum(i-k+1..i) − W)^2, using prefix sums for O(1) range sums. Reconstruct weeks and analyze time/space?</title>
