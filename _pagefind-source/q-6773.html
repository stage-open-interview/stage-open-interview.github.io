  <title>Context: A PayPal-scale, multi-tenant payments platform runs microservices on Kubernetes across AWS/GCP with a shared GPU-backed inference service. A rogue tenant could attempt cross-tenant data or token leakage through a compromised sidecar or cached data. Propose an advanced, production-grade runtime security plan to prevent cross-tenant data leakage and token misuse. Include per-tenant isolation, envelope-encrypted secrets with per-tenant keys, workload identity with SPIRE, service mesh mTLS, runtime attestation, CI policy checks, and a 24-hour incident response playbook with measurable success criteria?</title>
