  <title>In a Databricks data pipeline, ingest 3 GB/day Parquet logs from S3 via Auto Loader into a Bronze Delta table. Build a Silver layer that enriches each event with a small static dimension table customers (customer_id, country, segment) through a left join, deduplicates by event_id, and supports 2-minute late data with a watermark. Partition by event_date; broadcast the small dimension; enforce Unity Catalog RBAC and a lightweight test plan. How would you implement the enrichment join and tests?</title>
