  <title>You deploy 24 environmental sensors across a data center to monitor temperature, humidity, airflow, and power draw. Measurements mix linearly and nonstationarity arises as workload shifts. Design an online, convolutive ICA pipeline to separate independent sources in near real-time on edge hardware. Cover: (i) whitening strategy and frame-based processing, (ii) per-bin ICA vs joint diagonalization, (iii) cross-frequency permutation alignment, (iv) handling intermittent sensor dropout, (v) latency target (&lt;150 ms), and (vi) evaluation with ground-truth sources and artifacts?</title>
