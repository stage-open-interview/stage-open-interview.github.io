  <title>You&#039;re fine-tuning a multilingual customer-support QA model for a platform that serves three languages with strict latency (&lt;50 ms) and memory limits on a 20GB GPU. You have 60k QA pairs and domain-specific knowledge. Propose a concrete adapter-based fine-tuning plan: compare LoRA, QLoRA, and generic PEFT approaches; decide where to inject adapters (which layers or components); choose per-language adapters vs a shared adapter with language tokens; budget memory and compute for adapters; set ranks/alpha, training hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics (per-language accuracy, latency, memory, robustness). Include deployment notes and rollback strategy?</title>
