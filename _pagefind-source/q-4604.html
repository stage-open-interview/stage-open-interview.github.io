  <title>You&#039;re given a grid cost of size n x m. You start at (0,0) and must reach (n-1,m-1). You may move right, down, or diagonally down-right. Each diagonal move consumes one token from a budget of K; you may perform at most K diagonals in the path. What is the minimum total cost to reach the bottom-right, and what is the path (sequence of coordinates) taken? Propose a DP formulation with dp[i][j][t] as the minimum cost to reach (i,j) using exactly t diagonals, including recurrences, base cases, reconstruction, and a discussion of time/space?</title>
