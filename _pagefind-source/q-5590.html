  <title>In a Postgres-like data warehouse, a fact table &#039;sales&#039; is partitioned by month (range partitions) and joined to a &#039;products&#039; dimension. A typical query filters the last 90 days and aggregates revenue by product category, joining on product_id. EXPLAIN ANALYZE often shows scans across many partitions. How would you diagnose and fix to maximize partition pruning and minimize cross-partition work? Provide concrete steps?</title>
