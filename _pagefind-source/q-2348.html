  <title>Design a two-account AWS CI/CD pipeline for a microservices app running on ECS Fargate behind an ALB, source from GitHub, with CodePipeline and CodeBuild. Deploy to staging in Account A and production in Account B. Use CodeDeploy for blue/green deployments, store artifacts in a central S3 bucket, and implement promotion to prod only after 24h of synthetic canaries (CloudWatch Synthetics) and real-user latency/error-rate below thresholds. Include IAM roles, Secrets Manager rotation, and minimal IaC sketches?</title>
