  <title>Design an epoch-based reclamation scheme for a lock-free stack in a 64-bit, multi-threaded user-space library. Each thread publishes its local epoch; a global clock advances periodically. On pop, move the node to a retire-list with its epoch and reclaim only after all threads have observed an epoch older than that node. Include a stress test with high contention?</title>
