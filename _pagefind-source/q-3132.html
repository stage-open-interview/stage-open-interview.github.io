  <title>Design an in-memory, concurrent stream join operator for two input streams A and B. Each event has a key and a timestamp. Implement a per-key sliding-window equi-join with multiple worker threads that can process different keys in parallel, but guarantee in-order output per key. Bound memory usage with eviction, and apply backpressure when downstream slows. Compare locking vs lock-free implementations and outline testing strategies and failure scenarios?</title>
