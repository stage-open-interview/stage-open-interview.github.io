Design a beginner-friendly AWS-only event-driven pipeline (no polling) that normalizes input to JSON, runs sentiment analysis with Amazon Comprehend, redacts PII from text, stores both the original and sanitized JSON in S3, and upserts an index in DynamoDB with reviewId, userHash, sentiment, and s3Key.
