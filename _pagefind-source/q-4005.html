  <title>Design an end-to-end NLP pipeline that processes live corporate communications across 30 languages to extract and classify legally sensitive clauses (liability caps, indemnities, data processing terms), redact PII, and surface explainable risk scores in a centralized dashboard with tenant isolation and privacy guarantees. Include model versioning, drift detection, rollback, and a comparison of rule-based vs learned approaches for clause detection, with latency target under 250 ms per message?</title>
