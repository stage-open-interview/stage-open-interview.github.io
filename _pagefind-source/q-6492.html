  <title>Design a cross-region Azure Data Lakehouse for a payment platform: real-time transaction events flow from Azure Event Hubs (JSON) at ~2–5 MB/s; daily partner CSVs land via SFTP into ADLS Gen2. Requirements: (1) Delta Lake with schema evolution and upserts for SCDs, (2) under 2-minute latency for dashboards, (3) end-to-end data lineage to Purview, (4) cost-efficient storage with tiering and retention, (5) disaster recovery via cross-region replication. Which components and data flow would you implement and why?</title>
