  <title>Design a KCA onboarding workflow for 20k edge gateways deployed across regions where each device boots with hardware attestation and a measured firmware hash. The regional CA issues a 12-hour TLS client certificate bound to the firmware hash and attestation identity. Describe enrollment, firmware-hash policy binding, renewal on upgrade, rollback revocation via OCSP/CRLs, offline root fallback, and comprehensive auditing. Include a practical test plan with upgrade/rollback scenarios?</title>
