  <title>In a Databricks pipeline, 10–20 GB/day of Parquet clickstream data lands in S3 and is loaded into a Bronze Delta table via Auto Loader, with a Silver layer that must cope with weekly schema drift (new fields, renamed columns) and perform event_id deduplication, before a Gold aggregation layer used for dashboards. Describe an implementation that enables robust Delta Lake schema evolution, preserves downstream query compatibility, and includes a lightweight test plan to validate drift handling across environments. How would you guard against breaking changes while keeping retroactive queries correct?</title>
