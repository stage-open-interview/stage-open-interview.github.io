  <title>You&#039;re launching a personalized recommendation engine for an e-commerce platform with 120k concurrent users during peak hours. The stack includes a GPU-backed inference service for re-ranking, a Redis cache, Kafka streaming, and a REST frontend. Design a performance test plan to measure end-to-end latency, cache efficacy, and backpressure handling. Include workload profiles, target SLAs (e.g., p95 latency &lt; 1.2s at 99%), data freshness constraints, ramp schedules, autoscaling triggers, and failure scenarios (cache eviction, broker lag)?</title>
