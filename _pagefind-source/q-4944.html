  <title>Design a data structure to store a multiset of strings with operations: insertWord(word), deleteWord(word) (delete one occurrence if present), and queryPrefixLength(prefix) that returns the total number of characters of all words starting with prefix. Duplicates counted. Propose a Trie-based implementation where each node tracks the total length of words in its subtree and the number of words ending at that node; explain updates for insert/delete and how to answer the prefix query?</title>
