  <title>Context: You maintain three Terraform repos (network, apps, data) with per-environment backends. A new cost-governance rule blocks any plan that would increase estimated monthly cost by more than $1,000 unless a cost-approval PR exists in a dedicated repo. Propose a concrete implementation: (1) a cost-bridge data source that reads a central catalog (S3/Vault) and annotates resources with cost metadata; (2) per-environment backends and remote state data sources; (3) a CI gate that runs terraform plan and validates the delta against the catalog and approval status; (4) minimal code fragments for the bridge and gating steps?</title>
