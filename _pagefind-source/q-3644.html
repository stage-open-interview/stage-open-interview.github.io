  <title>Design a data structure to process a stream of integers arriving one by one. Implement insert(x) and getMedian() that returns the current median after each insertion. Use two heaps: a max-heap for the lower half and a min-heap for the upper half. Describe balancing rules to keep sizes within one and how to compute the median for odd/even counts. Consider duplicates and streaming constraints?</title>
