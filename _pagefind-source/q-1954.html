  <title>On a Linux host running three CI runners as systemd services sharing a single NVMe and a 10 Gb NIC, a long-running build on one runner starves CPU and I/O, delaying others. Propose a production plan to guarantee fair CPU and I/O while preserving peak throughput: (a) per-service CPU limits via cgroup v2 and CPU affinity; (b) per-service I/O throttling with io.max and a suitable I/O scheduler (BFQ/mq-deadline); (c) CPU pinning and IRQ isolation; (d) validation with bursts and latency metrics?</title>
