  <title>Design a KCA onboarding and certificate lifecycle for an autonomous drone fleet deployed across three countries, operating with intermittent connectivity and strict flight-permission policies. Drones boot with hardware-backed keys and attestation; obtain a short-lived TLS client certificate from a regional CA, with policy-bound flight rights, cross-region trust, and automatic certificate rotation on rejoin. Include revocation via OCSP/CRLs, offline root fallback, auditing, and a 1-page test plan with realistic sorties?</title>
