  <title>Design a KCA workflow for a fleet of autonomous delivery robots that operate mostly offline in a city. Each robot boots with a hardware root, attests to a regional bootstrap service, and enrolls a CSR to a central KCA issuing a short-lived TLS certificate (TTL 900s) bound to a per-robot SPIFFE ID and a &#039;robot&#039; scope. Include per-district trust anchors, policy-driven cert rotation, offline revocation via a locally cached revocation registry, auditing, and a test plan for district handoffs and long offline reattestation latency?</title>
