  <title>In a build pipeline, N compile tasks run in parallel and must all finish before the linker runs. Design a barrier that blocks each task at barrier.wait() until all N tasks have arrived, then releases them to proceed. Implement two beginner-friendly approaches in Go (or Java/Python): (A) locks/condition variables; (B) channels/futures. Ensure the barrier is reusable for repeated builds, avoids deadlocks, and explain correctness and trade-offs?</title>
