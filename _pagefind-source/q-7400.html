  <title>Design a concurrency strategy for a real-time trading analytics engine that ingests streams from 10k tickers, computes moving-window aggregates, and emits per-ticker streams to downstream consumers. Propose a bounded work queue, per-ticker partitioned state, dynamic worker pool resizing, and robust backpressure signaling to prevent hot-ticker starvation. Include failure recovery, observability, and a minimal runnable example?</title>
