  <title>In a high-throughput data desk environment, design a KCA-based onboarding for 1,000 streaming data connectors across two data centers. Each connector boots with hardware attestation and obtains a 60-second TLS client certificate from a regional CA, rotated automatically on reconnection. Include enrollment, attestation checks, policy binding to data-stream permissions, cross-region trust, revocation (OCSP/CRLs), offline root fallback, auditing, and a test plan with simulated reconnections and data bursts?</title>
