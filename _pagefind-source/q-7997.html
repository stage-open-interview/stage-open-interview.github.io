  <title>Scenario: A Linux host runs dozens of containers with memory limits. Under peak load, the system sporadically kills processes via the OOM killer even though free memory appears available. Using only default tools, design a concrete diagnostic workflow to (1) confirm OOM events and identify the victim process and container, (2) determine which cgroup or kernel memory controller is triggering, (3) apply a safe mitigation (e.g., adjust container memory limits, tweak overcommit/swappiness, enable per‑cgroup memory accounting) while preserving observability. Include exact commands and example outputs?</title>
