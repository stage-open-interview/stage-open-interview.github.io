  <title>Design and implement a lock-free concurrent map using a skip-list with probabilistic levels, supporting O(log n) inserts, finds, and deletes under high contention. Use hazard pointers for memory reclamation and marked pointers for logical deletion. Provide node layout with per-level forward pointers, random level generator, and pseudocode for insert, search, and delete that avoids ABA. Include a minimal microbenchmark plan to validate throughput and correctness under heavy parallelism?</title>
