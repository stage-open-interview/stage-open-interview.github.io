  <title>You operate a large-scale IoT ingestion pipeline on GCP: millions of device events per minute flow from Pub/Sub into Dataflow (Apache Beam) and write to BigQuery. Design an architecture that guarantees near real-time processing with exactly-once semantics, handles late data, and supports schema evolution; include windowing, idempotent writes, backpressure, and a rollback/testing plan for Dataflow job updates.
