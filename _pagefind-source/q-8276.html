  <title>You&#039;re testing a GraphQL endpoint for a social app that returns a user profile with nested posts and comments. With 10k requests/min at peak and a risk of N+1 queries, design a beginner-friendly performance test to locate bottlenecks in the resolver and data-fetch layers without changing production code. Include a concrete load profile, metrics, data strategy, and how you would isolate the different layers?</title>
