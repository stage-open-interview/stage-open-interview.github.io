  <title>You&#039;re building a beginner Azure Functions timer job to enforce per-tenant TTL on logs stored in ADLS Gen2. TTLs are stored in Azure App Configuration per tenant. Describe how you would implement a timer-triggered Python function that reads TTL for each tenant, lists /logs/{tenantId}/ blobs, deletes those older than TTL, and logs actions for auditing. Include safety, idempotency, concurrency considerations, and testing. Also provide a minimal code snippet to delete a single blob given tenantId and blobPath?</title>
