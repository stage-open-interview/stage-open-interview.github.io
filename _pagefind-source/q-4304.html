  <title>Design an end-to-end real-time NLP system to detect and extract operational incidents from live developer chat in a large ML platform. Identify mentions of outages or degradations, classify severity (S0-S3), and extract structured fields (service, region, timestamp, user impact). Route tickets to a Jira-like system, enforce multi-tenant privacy, and keep latency under 120 ms per message. Include ingestion, architecture, evaluation, drift monitoring, and rollout plan?</title>
