  <title>Design a real-time fraud-detection pipeline on GCP (advanced). Ingest transaction events via Pub/Sub, compute streaming features with Dataflow, store raw events encrypted in Cloud Storage, and serve a Vertex AI online endpoint with Confidential Computing. Enforce a strict latency budget (P99 &lt; 250 ms) and a per-transaction cost ceiling, ensure per-region data residency, and implement Vertex AI Model Monitoring with automatic rollback to the previous model version and canary rollouts. Include feature-store schemas, data validation, and alert thresholds?</title>
