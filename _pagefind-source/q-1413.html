  <title>Design a real-time image ingestion pipeline on GCP for a multi-tenant SaaS app. Customers upload images to per-tenant Cloud Storage buckets with CMEK; a Pub/Sub topic notifies on new uploads; a Dataflow streaming job processes images to extract features and writes results to BigQuery, while archived copies are moved to per-tenant archive buckets. Outline architecture, IAM bindings, service account isolation, exactly-once guarantees (e.g., row_id dedup), and cost/latency trade-offs. Include monitoring and failure-response plan?</title>
