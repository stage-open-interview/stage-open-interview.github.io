  <title>Scenario: A process has two threads: T1 holds a mutex to update a shared log buffer; T2 is blocked trying to acquire the same mutex. A SIGINT is delivered to the process while T1 is in the middle of updating. Explain the sequence of events from signal delivery to termination, including the mutex state, potential race conditions, and safe patterns for signal handling in multi-threaded programs (like async-signal-safe handlers and deferred cleanup via a dedicated signal-handling thread or self-pipe)?</title>
