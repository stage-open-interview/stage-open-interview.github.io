  <title>Three producers generate events tagged by user id and time; a single in-memory sink aggregates per-user activity over a 1-second sliding window and emits a summary to a consumer. Implement a beginner-friendly concurrency solution in Go, Python, or Java that guarantees thread-safe window updates, handles late events (up to 200ms), and ensures the sink doesn&#039;t drop events under low backpressure. Provide runnable sketch and tests?</title>
