  <title>Context: in a real-time analytics pipeline for a video-conference system, dozens of producers emit events into a shared queue and multiple workers consume them. Implement a bounded, multi-producer, multi-consumer queue with capacity 1024. It must not drop messages while not full, block producers when full, support concurrent consumers, and support a clean shutdown. Describe API, invariants, and a simple synchronization strategy?</title>
