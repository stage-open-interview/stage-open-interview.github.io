  <title>In a policy graph with rules of the form (P ∧ Q) → R, (P ∧ R) → S, and (Q ∧ S) → T, plus a set of base facts that you may set to true as needed, is there an assignment making T true without violating any rule? Provide an algorithm to compute a minimal witness (smallest base set) and apply it to this instance to show T is derivable with base facts {P, Q}?</title>
