  <title>Scenario: five service statuses S1..S5, each in {T, F, U}. Constraints: (S1 → S2), (S3 ∨ S4 ∨ S5), and (S1 ∧ S3) → ¬S5. An additional global rule enforces at most two services are True. Is there an assignment with at least one U such that none of the constraints evaluates to F? Outline a 3-valued backtracking propagator and give a concrete satisfying example?</title>
