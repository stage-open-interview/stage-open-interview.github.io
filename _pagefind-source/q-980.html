  <title>Design a global streaming-to-batch data pipeline for a PayPal/Adobe/Netflix-scale analytics platform: ingest real-time clickstream from Event Hubs into ADLS Gen2, maintain a Delta Lake with drift-tolerant schema, mask PII at ingestion, expose masked aggregates via serverless SQL pool, and enforce end-to-end lineage with Purview while supporting cross-region DR and data residency. Which Azure components and patterns would you use, and how would you handle schema evolution and failure modes?</title>
