  <title>In a multi-tenant data platform on AWS with a shared data lake and event bus, outline a practical plan to prevent cross-tenant leakage as data and events flow through data-plane and message-plane. Include (1) ABAC with OPA, (2) SPIRE-like identities and mutual TLS, (3) ephemeral credentials with rotation to data stores and topics, (4) drift detection/remediation, and (5) a 72-hour IR playbook for credential leakage or cross-tenant exposure, with concrete tool choices and trade-offs?</title>
