  <title>Design a rate limiting system for a mobile banking API that must handle different limits based on transaction type and user risk level: low-risk users (1000 req/day), high-risk users (100 req/day), with stricter limits for sensitive operations like money transfers (10/hour) vs. balance checks (100/hour). How would you implement a dynamic rate limiter that adapts to real-time fraud detection signals?</title>
