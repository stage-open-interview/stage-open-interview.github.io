Data streams include user interactions (clicks, saves), job features, and user features. Propose a neural learning-to-rank model with listwise loss, a feature store for online inference, offline evaluation with NDCG@10 and calibration, and online rollout with staged A/B tests and bandit optimization for long-term engagement. Include drift detection, safe rollback, and privacy controls; outline data schemas and deployment plan?</title>
