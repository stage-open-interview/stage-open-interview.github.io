  <title>In a real-time chat system, multiple producers enqueue messages into per-room bounded queues and multiple consumers deliver to connected clients. Design a beginner-friendly concurrency solution (Go, Java, or Python) that guarantees producers block when a room&#039;s queue is full and consumers block when the queue is empty, while preserving per-room isolation and simple backpressure. Compare a mutex/condition-based queue versus a channel-based approach for bounded queues?</title>
