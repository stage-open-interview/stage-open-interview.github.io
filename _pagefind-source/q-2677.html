  <title>You&#039;re maintaining a small Cloud Run (fully managed) service named image-processor with a Git-driven CI; you want to enable per-branch deployments to isolated Cloud Run services (e.g., image-processor-dev, image-processor-staging, image-processor-prod) using only GCP-native tools. Outline concrete steps to build and push the container to Artifact Registry, deploy each environment with dedicated service accounts and IAM bindings, configure traffic routing so dev/staging canaries don&#039;t affect prod, implement a gating flow to promote from dev to staging to prod via Cloud Build triggers, and specify a rollback workflow if latency &gt; 2s or error rate &gt; 1% persists for 10 minutes. Include minimal Secrets Manager usage and monitoring setup?</title>
