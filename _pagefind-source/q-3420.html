  <title>Design a Python async event router that ingests NDJSON lines from an AsyncIterable[str], routes each line to a per-type Pydantic model registry based on a &#039;type&#039; field, supports hot-swapping of routing rules at runtime without restart, guarantees per-type in-order processing, and uses bounded asyncio.Queues to provide backpressure to downstream sinks. Include a minimal test scaffold showing a type A mapping to V1 and a runtime swap to V2?</title>
