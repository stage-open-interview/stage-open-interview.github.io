  <title>On a NUMA Linux host running latency-sensitive containers, 2–5 ms spikes appear under heavy CPU load. Describe an end-to-end investigation and fix focusing on IRQ affinity, softirq, and scheduler interplay. Include how to identify root cause with ftrace or perf, isolate a CPU, pin the latency task, redirect device interrupts away, and validate that throughput remains stable?</title>
