  <title>In a multi-tenant notebook service on Kubernetes, each notebook runs in a transient pod and pulls dependencies from a private registry. Design a concrete plan to sign the notebook artifact (notebook.ipynb) and its dependencies with cosign, publish SLSA attestations to a central registry, and enforce at runtime that only attested notebooks and dependencies are allowed to run. Include concrete signing commands, attestations storage, and a sample Kyverno/OPA policy plus integration steps with the notebook runner?</title>
