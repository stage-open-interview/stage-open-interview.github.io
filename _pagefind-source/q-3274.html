  <title>Context: A multi-tenant ML platform hosted on AWS/GCP with per-tenant model stores and a shared feature store. Tenants call hosted models via an API gateway. An adversary from one tenant probes a model and attempts to reconstruct sensitive data from outputs. Design a practical, end-to-end test plan to prevent model leakage and enforce data locality. Include differential privacy controls, per-tenant RBAC/ABAC/OPA, per-tenant secrets, ephemeral credentials, a CI gate to block leakage in notebooks, and a 48-hour IR/DR playbook with clear success criteria?</title>
