  <title>Design an asyncio-based streaming pipeline that consumes JSON lines of trades from a WebSocket. Route by symbol to per-symbol workers maintaining a bounded 5-minute sliding window. Each worker computes VWAP and a volume distribution, applying a hot-swappable per-symbol transformer registry. Offload heavy statistics to a ProcessPool, enforce per-symbol in-order delivery, bounded memory, and backpressure to the source. Include a test scaffold with two symbols and a runtime transformer swap A-&gt;A2?</title>
