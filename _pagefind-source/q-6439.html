  <title>In an edge-to-core IoT ingestion scenario, field devices stream data to AWS IoT Core in us-east-1. A Lambda in Account A validates and forwards data to S3 in Account B and writes audit events to a centralized CloudTrail/S3 bucket in Account C. Design a security model to ensure device identity, restrict data egress, protect data in transit and at rest with rotation, enforce least privilege across accounts, and provide immutable audit logs and incident response capabilities. Include: device certificates, IoT policies, IAM roles, a KMS CMK with rotation, S3 bucket policies, PrivateLink/VPC Endpoints, and a test plan?</title>
