  <title>In a small rule engine, five predicates A,B,C,D,E take values in {T,F,U}. The rules are: (A ∧ B) → C, (D ∨ E) → B, and (¬C) ∨ D. Is there an assignment with at least one U such that none of the rules evaluates to F under Kleene 3-valued semantics? Outline a backtracking propagation approach and walk through a concrete 3-step trace that yields a satisfying model with at least one U?</title>
