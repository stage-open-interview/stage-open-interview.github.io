  <title>Scenario: A two-region, multi-account SaaS with a central Analytics API in Region A Shared Services VPC exposed to Tenant VPCs in Region A and Region B via PrivateLink. Tenants require strict per-tenant isolation, sub-50ms latency, minimal cross-region transfer, and automatic DR failover to Region B. Propose a hub-and-spoke TGW design, PrivateLink replication across regions, region-aware DNS with private Hosted Zones and Route 53 Resolver rules, and Global Accelerator for near-real-time failover. Include observability and a DR test plan?</title>
