  <title>In a real-time task processing system, multiple producers enqueue jobs into a global bounded queue with capacity C. A fixed pool of workers consumes jobs. Extend a beginner concurrency pattern to support two priority levels: high and normal. High-priority jobs must be served before normal ones, while preserving FIFO within each priority. Producers should block when the queue is full. Implement backpressure signaling and outline a concrete test plan to verify ordering and backpressure?</title>
