  <title>In a Databricks data-engineer exercise, ingest daily Parquet logs of customer events from S3 into Delta Lake; events originate from several microservices with event_time in different time zones. Describe a beginner-friendly pipeline that uses Auto Loader, Bronze/Silver with a simple MERGE to upsert the latest per customer_id, standardizes timestamps to UTC, and validates with a lightweight data quality check (not null, reasonable ranges). Include a partitioning plan and a quick validation approach?</title>
