  <title>You&#039;re building a cross-region retail analytics data product in Azure. Ingest on-prem SQL Server CDC into ADLS Gen2 in each region, publish Delta Lake tables to Databricks and Synapse with incremental loads, end-to-end lineage, and contract-based access. Which Azure components and patterns would you use to guarantee incremental loads, schema drift tolerance, cross-region discovery via Purview, and secure data sharing with minimal latency and cost?</title>
