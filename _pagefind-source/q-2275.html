  <title>Design an advanced API testing plan for a high-scale analytics API with asynchronous batch report generation. The endpoint GET /tenant/{tenantId}/reports/{reportId} returns a report produced by a background worker that reads from a write-ahead log and stores results in a read-optimized store. Outline concrete tests for data correctness across tenants and roles, eventual consistency across regions, idempotent retries, failure modes (worker crash, MQ outage), and performance under burst traffic. Include tooling and observability requirements?</title>
