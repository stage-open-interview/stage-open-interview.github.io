  <title>In a production on-call scenario, payments-service experiences intermittent failures with a 5-10% error rate and latency spikes during peak, while other services stay healthy. Outline a concrete, beginner-friendly incident runbook to diagnose, contain blast radius, and rollback safely within 30 minutes. Include data you collect (logs, traces, metrics), concrete alert thresholds, a minimal containment approach (toggle/traffic split), rollback criteria, and a quick validation plan before resuming traffic?</title>
