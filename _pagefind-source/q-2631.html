  <title>You&#039;re building a React Native field map app that shows a live route panel with up to 500 waypoints delivered over a WebSocket. Design a component architecture that minimizes re-renders, handles backpressure when bursts occur, and keeps the map smooth at 60fps. Provide a concise implementation sketch for a useLiveWaypoints hook (buffering and a render queue) and a minimal native bridge sketch if needed. What tests would you add to verify performance and correctness?</title>
