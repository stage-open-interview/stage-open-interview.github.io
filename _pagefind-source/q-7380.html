  <title>Design a beginner-friendly KCA workflow for a mobile device fleet where onboarding occurs via an OIDC-based bootstrap, a regional bootstrap service verifies a device attestation, and the device enrolls a CSR to a central KCA that issues a short-lived TLS certificate (TTL 900s) bound to a per-device SPIFFE ID and a mobile scope. Include per-tenant policy binding, online/offline revocation, audit logs, and a minimal test plan covering certificate rotation, roaming between regions, and revocation scenarios?</title>
