  <title>Design a KCA onboarding for a global fleet of 5,000 IoT/edge devices migrating from RSA TLS to post-quantum TLS during active operation. Devices boot with hardware-backed keys and attestation-based CSR; regional CAs issue both RSA and PQC certificates with 6-hour lifetimes, automatic renewal on reconnect, and cross-region trust. Include dual-PKI policy binding, revocation (OCSP/CRLs), offline root fallback, auditing, and a 1-page test plan with PQC handshake fallbacks and rollback?</title>
