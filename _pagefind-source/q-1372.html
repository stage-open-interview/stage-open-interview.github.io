  <title>Design a beginner-friendly, end-to-end pipeline to generate a daily per-user cca_score from 20-50k events/day across services. Each event has event_id, user_id, type (view, click, purchase), ts. Weights: view 0.2, click 0.5, purchase 2.0. Handle out-of-order data with a 4-hour watermark, deduplicate by event_id, and support day-level corrections (if a repair event arrives, recompute that day and upsert). Describe data schema, ETL steps, dedup strategy, and a minimal test plan?</title>
