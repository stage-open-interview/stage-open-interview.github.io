  <title>Scenario: A global mobile game tracks live player proximity and matches. Redis stores nearby players for fast proximity queries, MongoDB holds player profiles and active matches, Cassandra records hourly heatmaps, and DynamoDB archives daily aggregates. For a new location update, design concrete write paths including key schemas, TTLs, and cross-store invalidation, and describe how you would query the nearest 10 players and refresh Redis cache?</title>
