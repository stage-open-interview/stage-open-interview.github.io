  <title>In a newly opened city, you have a ride request dataset with features: hour_of_day, day_of_week, weather, pickup_zone, surge, and target ride_accepted (binary). Design a practical baseline pipeline to predict the probability a ride is accepted within 2 minutes of dispatch. Include preprocessing, model choice (logistic regression vs gradient boosting), handling imbalance, offline eval, and a plan to monitor drift after deployment?</title>
