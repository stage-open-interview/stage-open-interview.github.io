  <title>Design a data structure that maintains a dynamic multiset of strings with operations insert(word), erase(word) removing a single occurrence, countWithPrefix(prefix) returning how many words start with the prefix, and mostFrequentWithPrefix(prefix) returning the most frequent word among those starting with the prefix (tie-break lexicographically). What data structure would you implement, and what are the time complexities and invariants?</title>
