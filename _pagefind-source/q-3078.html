  <title>You model a SQL-like WHERE clause with 4 predicates A,B,C,D each taking values TRUE, FALSE, or UNKNOWN. The formula is F = (A OR NOT B) AND (C XOR D). Is there an assignment that uses at least one UNKNOWN and makes F evaluate to TRUE under Kleene three-valued logic? Outline a concrete 3-valued propagation algorithm and a backtracking strategy to verify arbitrary such constraints?</title>
