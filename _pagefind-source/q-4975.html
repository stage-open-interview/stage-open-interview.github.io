  <title>In a Consul Connect mesh on Kubernetes with two clusters linked via mesh gateway, the service &#039;checkout-frontend&#039; in cluster A intermittently fails to call &#039;inventory-service&#039; in cluster B during peak traffic; DNS resolves but requests are dropped at the cross-cluster gateway with 502 responses. Design a beginner-friendly end-to-end debugging workflow to identify whether the issue is DNS (CoreDNS/Consul DNS), cross-cluster service identity, gateway policy, or mTLS handshake, including concrete commands, config checks, and a rollback plan?</title>
