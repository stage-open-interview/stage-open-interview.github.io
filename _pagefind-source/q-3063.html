  <title>In a multi-account AWS org serving multiple units, an attacker is suspected of creating cross-account IAM roles and an abnormal trust policy to access data across accounts. Design an automated incident response workflow that detects, quarantines, and recovers from this compromise. Include detection signals (GuardDuty, CloudTrail), credential revocation, SCP/IAM isolation, secret rotation, CMK rotation, immutable log preservation, and a post-incident audit plan - how would you test and validate this workflow?</title>
