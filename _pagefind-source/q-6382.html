  <title>Design a Terraform multi-repo pattern for a shared network bridge across environments using per-environment backends and a remote state data source. The network repo publishes VPC ID and subnet IDs via a remote state, and the apps repo reads these values as data sources. Propose governance with per-environment backends, a read-only data bridge, and a gating policy that blocks apply if the shared data drifts or is modified without approval. Include minimal data source snippet and a GitHub Actions gate that runs terraform init and plan and validates read-only data changes?</title>
