  <title>In a multi-region telemetry ingestion pipeline, devices in three regions emit JSON events to region-local Kinesis streams. Design a beginner-friendly data-lineage approach that records a lineageId at ingest, stores provenance in DynamoDB, and writes Parquet files to S3 with region/date partitions, ensuring lineage is traceable across stages. Describe how to backfill the last 24 hours and how you would validate lineage integrity during queries in Athena. Include a simple monitoring plan?</title>
