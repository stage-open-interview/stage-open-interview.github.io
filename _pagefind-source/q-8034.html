  <title>Design a beginner-friendly KCA workflow for a CI/CD build farm that spawns ephemeral build agents per pipeline. Each agent boots from a pre-provisioned image, attests to a regional bootstrap service, enrolls a CSR to a central KCA issuing a short-lived TLS certificate (TTL 600s) bound to a per-build SPIFFE ID and a &#039;ci-build&#039; scope. Include per-project policy binding, revocation (online/offline), auditing, and a minimal test plan for parallel builds and credential rotation?</title>
