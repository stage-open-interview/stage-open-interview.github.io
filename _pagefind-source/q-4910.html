  <title>Maintain a dynamic topological order for a directed graph as edges are inserted in batches of size B. After each batch, if the graph remains acyclic, output a valid topological order; if a cycle appears, provide a short certificate. Propose a practical scheme that (i) uses the current order and only reorders affected nodes, (ii) triggers a full topo recomputation after a threshold of work, and (iii) includes two optimizations and a complexity/space comparison to recomputing from scratch after every batch?</title>
