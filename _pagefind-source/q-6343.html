  <title>Scenario: A new privacy regulation requires aggressive minimization of PII shared among rider, driver, and payments services. A legacy pattern streams PII into analytics with a 3-week rollout. With a 72-hour incident deadline, outline a STAR-based plan: observe the data flows, reproduce the leakage, map risk, decide between quick mitigations (masking/feature flag) and a longer-term refactor, implement and verify, and report decisions with rollback plans and success metrics?</title>
