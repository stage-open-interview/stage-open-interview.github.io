  <title>Design a REAL end-to-end test for a Stripe-like checkout in a multi-region, multi-tenant system. The test should validate a user places an order, an authorization is sent to a payment provider, an invoice is generated, and settlement completes across two regions. Include how you isolate test data, simulate regional outages, verify eventual consistency and idempotency, and ensure replay-safety of event logs after retries. Specify tooling and concrete steps?</title>
