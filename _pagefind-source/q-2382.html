  <title>In a regional microservice mesh with DNS-based routing and TLS termination at edge gateways, intermittent p95 latency spikes occur during peak hours despite healthy synthetic tests. No app changes allowed. Outline a concrete diagnostic plan to distinguish DNS routing churn, edge TLS handshake variability, and backbone path changes, with exact commands, data to collect, and a practical mitigation path?</title>
