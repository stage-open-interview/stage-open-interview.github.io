  <title>Design an Azure DevOps pipeline to deploy a microservices app to two AKS clusters in EastUS and WestUS using a single GitOps repo watched by ArgoCD. Configure region-specific secrets in Azure Key Vault, and expose the service via Azure Front Door with health-based routing and weighted failover. Include blue/green production promotion, automated smoke/integration tests, automatic rollback by re-syncing ArgoCD to the previous revision and pausing traffic, and a one-click disaster-recovery drill validating failover within 15 minutes?</title>
