  <title>Advanced AWS design: You run a multi-tenant analytics SaaS where per-tenant data residency is mandatory (data must stay in the tenant&#039;s region), but global dashboards must aggregate across tenants. Describe an end-to-end architecture using AWS services such as S3 IAM KMS Lambda Glue Athena Redshift API Gateway Cognito QuickSight that enforces per-tenant locality, supports automated on boarding off boarding, cross region analytics replication, and a disaster recovery strategy with defined RTO and RPO. Include security cost and scalability considerations?</title>
