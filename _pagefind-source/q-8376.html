  <title>You need to design a globally distributed order and balance service for a high‑volume trading app that must scale to millions of users with peak market-open traffic. Propose a sharding strategy (hash-based on user_id vs range), replication across three regions, and a data-consistency model. How would you coordinate cross‑shard transactions, perform online rebalancing with zero downtime, and ensure idempotent retries and accurate balance reads under eventual consistency?</title>
