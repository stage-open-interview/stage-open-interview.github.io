  <title>Design a runtime-extensible API gateway policy engine where routing decisions, auth, and rate-limiting are driven by pluggable policies that can be registered at runtime without redeploying. Each policy implements a minimal interface and is discovered via a registry. Show minimal interfaces, a registry shape, and an example of adding a new &#039;geo-aware&#039; rate-limiting policy. How would you ensure thread-safety and downtime-free hot reload during policy updates?</title>
