  <title>Design a prompt lifecycle manager for an enterprise AI assistant used in risk analytics at a Meta/Goldman Sachs‑type shop. The system stores multiple prompt templates (risk-summary, audit-report, executive-brief) and a policy engine. Create a lightweight policy language to express constraints (privacy, data-minimization, no secrets leakage, auditable traces) and a routing strategy that (i) selects a template based on user intent and data-sensitivity, (ii) enforces policies before routing, (iii) emits an auditable log and safe fallback. Provide a minimal Python prototype that evaluates a prompt against policies and returns allow/modify/deny with reasons, and outline testing with adversarial prompt injections and edge cases like conflicting policies or missing data. Include a simple flow diagram?</title>
