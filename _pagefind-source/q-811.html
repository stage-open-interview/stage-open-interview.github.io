  <title>In a real-time analytics service, multiple producers enqueue data into a fixed-size circular buffer consumed by multiple workers. Design a beginner-friendly concurrency solution in Java, Go, or Python that guarantees producers block when the buffer is full and consumers block when empty, while maintaining correctness under concurrent access; compare lock-based vs channel-based approaches for this bounded buffer?</title>
