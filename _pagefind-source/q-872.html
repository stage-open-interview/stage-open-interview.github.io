  <title>You are evaluating two deployment options for a new AI inference service under budget and latency constraints. Outline a practical, end-to-end cost-benefit analysis framework to decide which to deploy in production. Include: data you would collect (traffic, latency, SLA penalties, accuracy), metrics (NPV, ROI, payback), horizons, discount rate, handling uncertainty (scenarios), and a concrete calculation workflow you would run?</title>
