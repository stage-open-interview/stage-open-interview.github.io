  <title>You maintain a growing list of N tasks with integer priorities. Operations arrive in batches of size B, appending new tasks. After each batch you must surface the current minimum priority quickly. Compare two schemes: (A) rebuild a heap from scratch after every batch; (B) insert the B new tasks into a single heap. Provide total time and per-operation costs, and derive the breakeven batch size B* in terms of N. Include memory usage considerations?</title>
