  <title>You&#039;re building a prompt lifecycle service for a multi-tenant chat assistant used by Tesla support and MongoDB customers. It must manage versioned templates, canary rollouts, per-tenant experiments, and safe rollback if a new version underperforms or violates safety guards. Describe the architecture, data model, and provide a minimal Python prototype that resolves the tenant&#039;s latest approved version and supports rollback via a veto gate?</title>
