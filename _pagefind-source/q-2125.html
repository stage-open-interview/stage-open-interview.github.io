  <title>You&#039;re building a React form with multiple controlled inputs that need to maintain their state during component unmounting/remounting (e.g., when switching between tabs in a single-page application). How would you implement a state management solution that preserves form state across component lifecycle changes while avoiding the performance pitfalls of lifting all state to a global store, and what specific React patterns would you use to handle this efficiently?</title>
