  <title>You&#039;re building a delivery-driver app at Uber-scale or Scale AI where push notifications must reliably navigate to the correct screen even when the app is backgrounded or killed. Describe a notification router architecture that maps payloads to routes, persists last navigated state, prevents duplicate navigations, and handles data-payload vs notification-payload differences. Include a small hook sketch that debounces navigation and a minimal navigation service using react-navigation?</title>
