  <title>Design an intermediate concurrency problem: a real-time telemetry processor with per-device time-windowed aggregates. N producers emit {device_id, ts, value} readings; readings may arrive out of order and late by up to L seconds. Implement a bounded per-device window manager that computes min, max, sum, count in fixed-size windows [start, end). Use M workers to maintain per-device buffers, advance a watermark, and emit aggregates when windows close. Enforce memory bounds, allow dynamic worker resizing, and define late-data policy with at-most-once vs at-least-once semantics. Provide data structures and a concrete test plan?</title>
