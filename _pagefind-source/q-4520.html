  <title>You&#039;re managing two Terraform repos: network (VPC/subnets) and app (container service). A new requirement is for a centralized monitoring stack to consume VPC/subnet IDs as read-only data from the network repo without creating deployment coupling, while dev/prod remain isolated. Describe a concrete implementation plan detailing per-environment backends, remote state data sources to feed app and monitoring repos, and a CI gate to enforce a whitelist of plan changes before promotion?</title>
