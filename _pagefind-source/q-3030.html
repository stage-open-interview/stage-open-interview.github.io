  <title>Design a per-tenant model versioning and policy-drift system for a globally distributed LLM inference service used by regulated tenants (e.g., fintechs, exchanges). Requirements: pin tenants to specific model versions with staged canary rollouts; detect policy drift in near real-time by comparing outputs to policy gold references; auto-rollback to a previous version on drift/quality triggers; enforce strict data locality and tamper-evident logging. Outline architecture, data flows, and observability, and provide a minimal Python prototype for drift checking?</title>
