  <title>Design a beginner Azure DevOps YAML pipeline that performs a blue/green deployment of a microservice to Azure Container Apps. It should build the Docker image, push to ACR, deploy blue, fetch per-environment secrets from Azure Key Vault and feature flags from App Configuration, perform a health check on blue, switch traffic to green upon success, and keep blue as a rollback option for a 24-hour window; tear down after PR close and log all steps to Azure Monitor Logs. How would you implement this?</title>
