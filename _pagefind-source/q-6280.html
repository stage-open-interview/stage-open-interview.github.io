  <title>In a color image created by mixing two grayscale textures via a 3×2 mixing matrix into an RGB image, design a beginner ICA pipeline to recover the two texture sources. Tasks: (i) patch-wise whitening and 2×3 ICA to estimate a 2-source demixer, (ii) align sources across patches, (iii) reconstruct full image textures, (iv) evaluation using SSIM/PSNR against ground-truth textures and a simple visual check?</title>
