  <title>Scenario: A 4-node Kubernetes cluster runs a StatefulSet-backed database managed by a custom operator. The operator is being upgraded from v0.9 to v1.0, which introduces a CRD version migration (CRD v1alpha1 -&gt; v1). Provide a concrete, command-driven upgrade plan that preserves data, migrates existing CRs safely, updates RBAC and the operator Deployment, coordinates a canary rollout, and validates with in-cluster checks. Include exact kubectl apply commands, CRD version validation, canary criteria, and rollback steps?</title>
