  <title>KCNA multi-tenant: design a tenant-aware partition reallocation mechanism that allows a tenant to scale out by moving a subset of its partitions to new brokers without stopping producers/consumers. Describe data structures for per-tenant partition ownership, the protocol (graceful stop, fence commits) to transfer ownership, how to preserve per-tenant order and exactly-once delivery, and a test plan with canaries and rollback procedure?</title>
