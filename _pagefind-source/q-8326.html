  <title>Dynamic 2D convex hull with batched insertions: Points are added to a set P in batches of size B. After each batch, we must (a) report the area of Conv(P) and (b) answer whether a fixed query point q lies inside Conv(P). Propose a practical incremental structure that (i) preprocesses efficiently, (ii) updates amortized per batch, (iii) yields hull-area in O(1) and membership test in O(log h), (iv) uses near-linear space, (v) includes two optimizations, (vi) compares to rebuilding after each batch. Give asymptotics in n=|P|, B?</title>
