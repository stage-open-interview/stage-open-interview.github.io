  <title>On a Linux host serving low-latency ML inference REST endpoints, tail latency spikes under peak load while average latency stays acceptable. Using only default tools, design a concrete diagnostic workflow to (1) determine if tail latency is due to CPU, memory, IO, or interrupts, (2) identify the bottlenecked core/NUMA domain and the offending process, and (3) propose a safe mitigation (e.g., CPU pinning, shielding, IO scheduler tweaks) while preserving observability. Include exact commands and expected outputs?</title>
