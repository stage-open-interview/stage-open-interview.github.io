  <title>You&#039;re building an AWS-native pipeline to ingest ML training assets uploaded as tarballs (&lt;=200 MB) to S3. On upload, design an event-driven flow that unpacks assets with Lambda, validates a manifest against a schema, runs a lightweight auto-labeling pass via a SageMaker JumpStart endpoint, redacts PII in metadata, stores labeled assets back to S3, and upserts a DynamoDB index with datasetId, manifestKey, assetCount, and labelQuality. Include IAM, encryption, error handling, and cost controls?</title>
