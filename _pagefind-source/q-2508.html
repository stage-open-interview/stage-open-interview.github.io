  <title>In a Knative-based FaaS layer on Kubernetes, functions are built as OCI images stored in a private registry and loaded by the function runtime at cold start. Design an end-to-end plan to sign and attest function images, publish attestations to Rekor, and enforce at runtime that only attested functions execute in the Knative namespace. Include concrete cosign commands, attestation storage approach, and a sample Kyverno or OPA policy plus integration steps with the registry and the function loader?</title>
