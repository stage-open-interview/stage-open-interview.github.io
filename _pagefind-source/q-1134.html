  <title>You&#039;re building a beginner-level Azure OpenAI-powered chat assistant for a rideshare service that serves clients in two regions. Outline a concrete data path and a minimal routing implementation that ensures user messages and model outputs stay in-region. Include a TypeScript function that selects the regional OpenAI endpoint based on client region, a latency fallback policy, and basic in-region logging to Azure Monitor. Provide testing approaches?</title>
