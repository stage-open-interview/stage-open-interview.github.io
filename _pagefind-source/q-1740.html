  <title>Advanced cross-repo Terraform: network state is stored in a dedicated repo/backends across envs. The application repo imports VPC IDs and subnets via data terraform_remote_state. Explain how you would structure backends and modules to avoid drift, ensure isolation between dev/staging/prod, and orchestrate safe promotions from dev to prod with exact commands for init/plan/apply per environment. Include how you would test drift and rollback?</title>
