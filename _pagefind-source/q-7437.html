  <title>Scenario: A multi-tenant Linux host with containerized services runs on a dual-socket NUMA system. Under sustained load, tail latency spikes appear for a payment service. Using only default tools, design a concrete diagnostic workflow to (1) verify NUMA imbalance and cross-node memory access, (2) identify the containers and memory nodes involved, and (3) apply a safe mitigation (e.g., pin memory/CPUs with numactl, isolate a socket, or adjust memory policy) while preserving observability. Include exact commands and example outputs?</title>
