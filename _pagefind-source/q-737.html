  <title>In a messaging pipeline used by Zoom and Hugging Face, the system tokenizes, normalizes, and stores messages. You want to support swapping in different normalization strategies (lowercasing, diacritic removal, profanity filtering) without changing the pipeline code. Design the architecture using a design pattern that lets you add new normalization strategies without modifying the pipeline. Provide a minimal interface and a usage example. How would you implement this pattern to make additions painless?</title>
