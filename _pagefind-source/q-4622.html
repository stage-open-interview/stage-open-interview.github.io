  <title>You&#039;re building a global, multi-tenant AI feature store on Azure for tenants across major platforms (e.g., Meta, DoorDash, Hugging Face). Ingest telemetry from mobile/web via Azure Event Hubs, process in Azure Databricks to derive features, store raw data in ADLS Gen2, and publish derived features to a real-time feature store in Azure SQL/Delta Lake with per-tenant isolation. How would you design data contracts, enforce tenant-level access, support cross-region replication, ensure privacy controls, and validate disaster recovery and cost constraints?</title>
