  <title>On a single Linux host running multiple Python services in separate cgroups, tail latency spikes under peak load even though aggregate CPU usage stays under 70%. Using only default tools, design a concrete diagnostic workflow to (1) determine if tail latency is due to CPU throttling by cgroups, (2) identify which cgroup and process is hitting quotas, and (3) propose a safe mitigation (e.g., adjust quotas, shares, or migrate a heavy service to its own host) while preserving observability. Include exact commands and expected outputs?</title>
