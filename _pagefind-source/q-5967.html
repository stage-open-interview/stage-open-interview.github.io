  <title>Scenario: A four-account data lake (Security, Data, Apps, Partners) houses PII in S3 with Athena/Glue. A partner needs two weeks of read-only access to a partitioned dataset. Design a secure, auditable pattern that enforces least privilege, prevents exfiltration, and supports incident response. Include: cross-account RAM shares and a time-bound role; a centralized CMK with rotation in Security; S3 Object Ownership and Object Lock (Governance) for retention; private connectivity (VPC endpoints/PrivateLink); Lake Formation permissions with ABAC; Secrets Manager rotation for any credentials; and a test plan to prove no privilege creep or leakage. Outline steps and verification approach?</title>
