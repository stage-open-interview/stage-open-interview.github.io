  <title>Given a directed graph with N nodes and M weighted edges (positive weights) and a source s, describe an implementation to (1) identify nodes reachable from s via BFS, (2) compute shortest distances dist[] to all nodes with Dijkstra, and (3) count the number of distinct shortest s→v paths for every v (mod 1e9+7). How would you build a DAG of edges on shortest paths and perform a topological DP over dist-ordered nodes to obtain path counts?</title>
