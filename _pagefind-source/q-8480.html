  <title>Design a data structure to maintain a real-time event stream with time stamps; each event has a timestamp t and weight w. Support: addEvent(t,w) and pruneOld(now) that removes events with t &lt; now - W. Answer queries: sumWeightsInWindow(now) and kthLargestWeightInWindow(now, k) for the weights of events in the last W seconds. Aim for amortized O(log M) updates and O(log M) queries, where M is distinct weights. Explain how you handle duplicates, time pruning, and coordinate compression?</title>
