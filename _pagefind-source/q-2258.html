  <title>You&#039;re deploying a real-time sentence-embedding model in TensorFlow 2.x behind TensorFlow Serving on Kubernetes for a high-throughput API. How would you architect deterministic dynamic batching to coalesce requests with varying sequence lengths, ensuring tail latency stays under 20 ms while preserving embedding quality, including choices between TF Serving batching versus a custom batching layer, handling bucketing/padding, and validation/rollback plans?</title>
