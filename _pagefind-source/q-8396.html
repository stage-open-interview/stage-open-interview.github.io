  <title>In a 6-microphone wearable array on a moving vehicle, driver speech and ambient engine noise mix nonstationarily as the geometry drifts. Propose a real-time ICA pipeline that uses physics-informed priors from mic positions to adapt a time-varying mixing model and a demixing operator. Compare online whitening strategies, choose between per-bin ICA vs joint diagonalization, address intermittent data and latency (&lt;50 ms), with a concrete evaluation plan using ground-truth sources?</title>
