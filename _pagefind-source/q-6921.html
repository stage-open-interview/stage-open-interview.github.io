  <title>You&#039;re deploying an adaptive bitrate streaming feature in a regional video platform. During a major live event, 50k viewers in Region A access concurrently with mixed networks (50% cellular, 50% Wi‑Fi). The pipeline includes client SDK, origin, transcoding pool, and edge caches. Design a performance-testing plan to validate end-to-end latency, startup time, stall rate, ABR switches, and autoscaling, including workload mix, metrics, failure scenarios, and how you emulate network variance?</title>
