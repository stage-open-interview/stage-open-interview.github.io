  <title>Design a runtime-rule engine for a financial transactions platform where new fraud-detection rules can be added without redeploying the engine; each rule computes a risk contribution (e.g., velocity-based spend, IP-geography mismatch, device fingerprint). Implement with a design pattern that lets you register new rules at runtime and apply them in a deterministic order to produce a final risk score and a pass/fail decision. Include minimal interfaces, a registry, and a usage example?</title>
