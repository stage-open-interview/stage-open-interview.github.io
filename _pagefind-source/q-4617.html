  <title>Design a beginner-friendly concurrency pattern for a real-time ingest system where producers submit messages tagged by dynamic topics. Each topic must preserve per-topic in-order delivery, while a bounded global queue and a small worker pool process items across topics. Topics can be created or removed at runtime; ensure backpressure signals to producers when quotas are reached and gracefully drain or archive messages on topic removal. Explain test plan for per-topic ordering under churn and for topic lifecycle events?</title>
