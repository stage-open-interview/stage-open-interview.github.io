  <title>In a two-DC Consul Connect mesh, a Kubernetes workload in DC1 named analytics-processor cannot reach a VM service data-warehouse in DC2 when cross-DC routing is enabled. The issue only manifests under load and after a policy update. Design an end-to-end debugging workflow to distinguish (a) ACL/identity for inter-DC calls, (b) cross-DC mesh gateway policy and service-resolver aliasing, or (c) cross-DC DNS resolution and caching. Include concrete commands, policy checks, and rollback steps?</title>
