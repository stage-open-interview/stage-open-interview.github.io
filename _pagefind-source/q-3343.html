  <title>In a three-account org (Data, Analytics, Security), partner data is ingested into a Kinesis stream in Data. Analytics consumes the stream and writes results to Redshift in Analytics. Design a least-privilege cross-account pattern: cross-account role trust, ABAC-based access by partnerId, strict action scoped to the stream and cluster, central CMK with rotation, private connectivity via VPC endpoints, immutable logs, and drift detection with tests.
