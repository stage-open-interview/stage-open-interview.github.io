  <title>Design a Terraform pattern for a two-repo architecture: network in us-east-1 and app in us-west-2. Export VPC and subnet IDs from the network repo via a remote state, and configure the app repo to read them as read-only data using data.terraform_remote_state and a provider alias for aws.us-west-2. Include backend configurations for both regions, a minimal data source snippet, and a CI gate that blocks apply if the plan would modify remote-state-derived IDs?</title>
