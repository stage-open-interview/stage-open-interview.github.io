  <title>Across two Consul Connect clusters (Kubernetes in AWS, on-prem bare metal), a new mesh gateway feature routes payments-frontend to currency-service by region. During traffic spikes, 20% of requests hit the wrong regional endpoint and fail with 502. Design a concrete end-to-end debugging workflow to determine if the issue stems from (a) DNS/region-based service discovery, (b) mesh gateway header rewriting or TLS config, or (c) ACL/intent enforcement lag during failover. Include exact commands, config checks, and a safe rollback plan?</title>
