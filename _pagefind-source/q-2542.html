  <title>Design a two-stage, bounded-concurrency pipeline for real-time video frames from multiple cameras. Stage 1 decodes frames (CPU-bound) using a fixed thread pool; Stage 2 runs an AI-based enhancer asynchronously. Ensure per-frame ordering across all cameras, backpressure to keep queues bounded, support dynamic worker scaling and clean shutdown with cancellation, and provide a runnable minimal sketch in a language of your choice?</title>
