  <title>On a Linux server hosting a lightweight web app, a bursty logging workflow writes many small files under /var/log/app and, during peak bursts, inode exhaustion occurs even though disk space remains. Propose a practical plan to prevent inode pressure and keep logs reliable. Include concrete steps for quick triage, log rotation strategies, filesystem choices or partitioning, and a test plan to reproduce bursts and verify stability?</title>
