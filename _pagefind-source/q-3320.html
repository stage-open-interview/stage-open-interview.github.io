  <title>You&#039;re building an edge-first, cross-region inference platform for an automotive telemetry company. Ground stations run on-device models with low latency; the central AWS control plane maintains a private SageMaker model registry and uses PrivateLink to gated data sources. Propose an architecture that (1) guarantees on-device inference latency targets, (2) prevents data leaving restricted networks, (3) supports canary model updates per gateway, (4) implements drift detection and automated rollback, and (5) provides auditability and per-tenant access controls. Include a sample rollout plan and validation steps?</title>
