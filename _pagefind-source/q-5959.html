  <title>In a multi-region AWS SAP deployment (SAP HANA on EC2 + SAP NetWeaver) spanning us-east-1 and eu-west-1, design an automated disaster recovery failover plan that guarantees a 15-minute RTO and no more than 5% data loss. Include: (1) how you would validate SAP HANA System Replication status and data consistency during failover, (2) how Route 53 DNS failover and health checks would orchestrate regional failover, (3) what IAM roles/policies and SCPs are required for cross-region operations, and (4) a minimal IaC snippet to provision Route 53 health checks and a cross-region IAM role?</title>
