  <title>Design a KCA workflow for a multi-region SaaS platform hosting per-tenant microservices and gateway proxies in Kubernetes clusters in us-east-1 and eu-west-1. Each service boots with a hardware-backed root (TPM), attests to a regional bootstrap service, and enrolls a CSR to a central KCA issuing a TLS cert TTL 300s bound to per-tenant SPIFFE ID and a &#039;svc&#039; scope. Include cross-region trust anchors, crypto agility with PQC fallback, revocation, auditing, and a test plan for cross-region handoffs and attestation latency?</title>
