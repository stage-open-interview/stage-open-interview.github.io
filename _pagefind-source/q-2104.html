  <title>Design a cryptographically verifiable data provenance system for a real-time GCP data lake (Pub/Sub -&gt; Dataflow -&gt; BigQuery -&gt; GCS) shared by three brands. How would you generate per-record provenance tokens, sign them with Cloud KMS, attach them to the data, rotate keys, and verify integrity at read time while preserving pipeline throughput? Include how you&#039;d store proofs, enforce tenant isolation, and rollback tests?</title>
