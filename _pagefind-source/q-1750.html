  <title>You&#039;re building a beginner-friendly AWS-only pipeline for multilingual customer recordings. Audio files (up to 90 seconds) are uploaded to S3. Design an event-driven flow that uses Amazon Transcribe to produce a transcript in the source language, Amazon Translate to produce a Spanish version, stores both transcripts in S3, and writes a compact index in DynamoDB with fields like customerId, fileKey, sourceLang, translatedKey. Include data flow, IAM, error handling, and privacy considerations?</title>
