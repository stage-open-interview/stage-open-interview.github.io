  <title>In a 3-region, multi-account SaaS deployment, enforce customer data locality so S3 data stays in the region defined by each customer and is not replicated cross-region unless explicitly approved. Design an automated policy engine using AWS Config custom rules, EventBridge, Lambda, and SCPs to prevent unauthorized replication, enforce region-bound KMS keys, and route alerts to a centralized security sink.
