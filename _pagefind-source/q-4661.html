  <title>You&#039;re building a beginner-friendly fraud-detection model for a fintech product. Data resides in a single-region S3 bucket. Use SageMaker Pipelines to train, register two models (base and challenger) in Model Registry, and deploy a two-model endpoint (Multi-Model Endpoint) with a 5% canary for 48 hours. Roll back if challenger accuracy drops by more than 1% relative to base or latency exceeds 300 ms; provide a practical plan including pipeline steps, metrics, rollback criteria, and a 30-day cost estimate?</title>
