  <title>In the Linux kernel, design a lock-free single-producer, multiple-consumer ring buffer for a device interrupt that enqueues event pointers. Describe the exact sequence and memory ordering you would enforce (which atomic ops, release/acquire semantics, and ABA avoidance), how you prevent data races across slots, and why a spinlock would be slower. Illustrate with a concrete interleaving involving two consumers and one producer?</title>
