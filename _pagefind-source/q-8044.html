  <title>Edge insertions only: You have a directed weighted graph G=(V,E) with nonnegative weights. Edges are online-inserted in batches of size B; no deletions. After each batch, design a practical incremental SSSP structure that (i) preprocesses in O(n log n + m) time, (ii) updates in amortized O(B log n) time, (iii) answers dist(s, v) in O(1) time for all v, (iv) uses O(n+m) space, (v) includes two optimizations, (vi) compares to recomputing Dijkstra after every batch. Provide asymptotics in terms of n, m, B?</title>
