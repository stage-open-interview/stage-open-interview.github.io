  <title>Two-region OLTP SaaS with a single writer in us-east-1 and read replicas in eu-west-1. Compare Aurora Global Database (PostgreSQL) vs DynamoDB Global Tables for this workload: latency targets, consistency model, failover behavior, and cost. Which approach would you pick and why, and what concrete configuration (replica count, failover window, write routing) would you implement to meet RTO &lt; 60s and RPO &lt; 5s?</title>
