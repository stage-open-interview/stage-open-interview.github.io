  <title>Context: A Meta/Microsoft/Zoom-like multi-tenant collaboration platform hosting per-tenant serverless functions and live messaging. A compromised function role token is observed being used to enumerate buckets in the central data lake and exfiltrate data from another tenant. Propose an intermediate, production-ready security test plan to validate tenant isolation and least privilege for serverless workloads. Include concrete abuse vectors to test, enforcement via per-tenant IAM with RBAC/ABAC, SPIRE/mTLS between services, ephemeral credentials, per-tenant secrets with rotation, CI gates to block secrets, observability gates, and a 48-hour IR/DR playbook with measurable success criteria?</title>
