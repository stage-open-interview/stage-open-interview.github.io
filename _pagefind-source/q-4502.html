  <title>On a single-core Linux-like system, two threads share a CPU: a CPU-bound worker and an I/O-bound worker that often sleeps on I/O. Explain how the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) uses vruntime and per-thread weights to decide which thread runs next, and why the I/O-bound thread tends to break up CPU time. Propose a minimal, practical adjustment (e.g., using cgroups cpu.shares or adjusting nice values) to improve fairness without sacrificing throughput?</title>
