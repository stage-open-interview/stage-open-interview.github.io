  <title>You&#039;re the on-call SRE for a global gaming platform using Kubernetes, Redis cache, and a microservices stack. During a peak event in US/EU, Redis latency P99 jumps to 600ms, causing timeouts and cascading errors. Propose an end-to-end incident response strategy: detection signals, triage steps, immediate mitigations to restore service, long-term fixes, and how you would validate resilience with controlled experiments. Include concrete metrics, autoscaling decisions, and data-plane vs control-plane considerations?</title>
