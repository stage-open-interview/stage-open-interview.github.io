  <title>You&#039;re building a real-time, multi-tenant prompt router for an all-in-one chat assistant used by Instacart, Tesla, and Netflix employees. The system must route each user prompt to one of three personas: support-centric, revenue-aware, and compliance-oriented, based on user role, prior interactions, context window, and explicit data-sensitivity cues. It should apply a safety veto for prompts that could leak policy or PII, and adjust routing to meet SLA targets. Describe the architecture, routing rules, and provide a minimal Python prototype that demonstrates persona selection and a veto gate for edge cases. How would you measure latency, correctness, and safety?</title>
