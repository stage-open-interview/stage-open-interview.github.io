  <title>On a Linux host running a multi-tenant data-collection service, tail latency spikes appear under 99th percentile during bursts. Outline a production plan to diagnose and mitigate root causes using eBPF tracing (bpftrace), per-tenant metrics, and strict QoS isolation. Include steps to install tracing, collect sched/net/block latency per tenant, enforce per-tenant cgroups v2 with cpu.max and io.max, and validate with synthetic bursts. What exact steps would you take and how would you revert if latency worsens?</title>
