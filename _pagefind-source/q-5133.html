  <title>Context: A multi-tenant SaaS on AWS uses EKS and a central data lake; the CI/CD pipeline builds microservices from GitHub and uses a shared registry. If a build runner is compromised, secrets and image tampering could occur across tenants. Generate a beginner-friendly security plan to secure the supply chain: enforce image signing with cosign/Sigstore, per-tenant registries and image provenance, CI secret scanning, and a 48-hour incident response playbook with runbooks and dashboards. Include concrete steps, tooling, and success criteria?</title>
