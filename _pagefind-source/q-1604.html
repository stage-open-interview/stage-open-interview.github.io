  <title>In a dbt pipeline powering a fintech analytics platform, raw events arrive at staging.fin_events with customer_id, txn_id, amount, currency, status, event_ts. Design an incremental analytics.transactions model that deduplicates by txn_id across sources, handles late events within a 2-day window, validates currency via a macro-based set per source, guards against schema drift with a dynamic mapping table, and snapshots customers on their first txn for dashboard lineage. Include tests and performance considerations?</title>
