  <title>You&#039;re building a daily workout planner. Over n days, you can pick Light (L) or Heavy (H) workouts, with a cooldown: after a Heavy, you must skip the next two days (no workouts). Given integers n and r, how many length-n sequences contain exactly r Heavy workouts and satisfy the cooldown rule? Provide a DP formulation with state dp[i][c][t] (days processed, cooldown days left, heavies used) and outline time/space complexity, edge cases, and a brief correctness justification?</title>
