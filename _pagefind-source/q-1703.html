  <title>Scenario: A healthcare analytics team has a dataset with 100 predictors, mix of continuous and binary indicators, plus missing values. They want to apply PCA to reduce to 5 components for a dashboard and as features for a simple logistic classifier. Describe the exact preprocessing steps, including handling missing data, dealing with binary features during PCA, scaling, and how you would decide the number of components. How would you translate the top loadings into interpretable dashboard signals for clinicians, and how would you validate this approach on a small holdout set?</title>
