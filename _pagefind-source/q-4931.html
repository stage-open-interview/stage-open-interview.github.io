  <title>You&#039;re tasked with performance testing a real-time IoT analytics pipeline that ingests 2M events per second via Kafka, processes with Spark Streaming, and serves dashboards from a Postgres read replica; autoscaling is enabled and an anomaly-detection service is external. Design a practical plan to validate end-to-end latency under a 10x burst for 5 minutes while preserving data integrity, covering workload model, metrics, tools, and failure scenarios, including autoscaling and backpressure verification?</title>
