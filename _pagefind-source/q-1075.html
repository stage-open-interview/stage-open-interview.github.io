  <title>You&#039;re building a beginner-friendly KCA flow for a data science platform where notebooks run in isolated containers across tenants. The platform uses a cloud CA to issue short-lived client certificates (2 hours) via token-based enrollment (JWT) rather than CSR, with a gateway that validates certs and maps tenants. Describe the enrollment flow, renewal, and how the gateway handles clock skew, expired certs, and failed enrollments. Include a minimal test plan and example API calls?</title>
