  <title>You&#039;re architecting a healthcare text classifier deployed on Vertex AI for a multi-tenant hospital network. You must ensure per-tenant isolation, strict compliance logging, explainability for clinicians, and robust drift handling with automatic rollback. Describe the end-to-end pipeline: data ingestion, per-tenant dataset versioning and catalog tagging, training with Vertex AI Experiments, evaluation with explainability metrics (SHAP), and deployment strategy with canary or blue/green rollouts, plus a drift-triggered rollback policy. Include concrete steps, sample schemas, and a simple fallback example when explainability degrades?</title>
