  <title>Dynamic SSSP under batch edge insertions: A directed graph with n nodes; edges are added online in batches of size B. After each batch, maintain approximate distances dist(s,v) from a fixed source s within a (1+ε) factor for all v. Propose a practical scheme using (i) a fixed landmark set L with precomputed dist(s,l) and dist(l,v), (ii) selective exact relaxations for nodes affected by the batch, and (iii) periodic rebuild. Provide preprocessing, per-batch update time, memory, and a comparison to recomputing SSSP from scratch?</title>
