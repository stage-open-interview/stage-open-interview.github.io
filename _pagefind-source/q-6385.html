  <title>In a real-time analytics service that ingests JSON lines over an asyncio stream, implement a memory-bounded per-user sliding-window processor. Ingest, validate with Pydantic, bucket events into a 60s sliding window (e.g., 1s buckets). Keep a bounded LRU cache: user_id -&gt; deque of buckets, pruning old users and buckets to cap memory. Emit per-user counts and avg latency to a sink when a window closes, and await sink to enforce backpressure. Test with bursty input and late arrivals up to 10s?</title>
