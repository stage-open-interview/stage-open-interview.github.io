  <title>Scenario: In a car cabin, a 14-mic array records a live meeting with engine and road noise. Design a real-time online convolutive ICA pipeline to separate up to 6 sources with moving talkers. Include: STFT-based mixing, whitening, online demixing with a 14×14 matrix, choice between per-bin ICA vs joint diagonalization, cross-bin permutation tracking, nonstationarity handling, latency target, and an evaluation plan with ground-truth sources and SDR/SIR?</title>
