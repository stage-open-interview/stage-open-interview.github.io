  <title>In a real-time multi-producer task queue, each task has a unique ID and must be processed exactly once. Producers submit tasks concurrently; workers may crash and tasks can retry. Design a beginner-friendly concurrency solution in Go or Python asyncio with a bounded global queue, a per-task dedup buffer, a small worker pool, and a crash-recovery protocol. Explain idempotence, backoff, and a concrete test plan?</title>
