  <title>As an Azure Solutions Architect for a global IoT telemetry platform with 100k tenants, design an Azure-native pipeline that ingests device telemetry from on-prem edge gateways, guarantees sub-500ms end-to-end latency for near-real-time dashboards, isolates tenant data in Delta Lake per-tenant, uses Event Hubs for ingest and Spark Structured Streaming for processing, stores in Synapse, enforces per-tenant RBAC with Azure AD, applies BYOK for data at rest, implements cross-region DR with active-active replicas, and provides a cost-optimization plan (auto-scaling, retention, quotas). What is the end-to-end data flow, components, and trade-offs?</title>
