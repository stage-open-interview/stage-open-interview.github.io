  <title>Context: A Linux host runs a Kubernetes-deployed real-time inference service behind Nginx; latency tail spikes occur during bursts. Without downtime, describe a concrete, repeatable workflow to determine whether latency is caused by CPU throttling, memory pressure, or network queueing, identify the offending container/pod, and apply a safe mitigation (e.g., adjust cgroup limits, scale the deployment, or tune kernel parameters) while preserving observability. Include exact commands, expected outputs, and a simple rollback plan?</title>
