  <title>Design a real-time, multi-tenant fraud-detection pipeline on GCP. Messages for each tenant arrive on a Pub/Sub topic as Avro with fields (tenant_id, event_id, amount, timestamp). Build a streaming Dataflow job that validates schema, deduplicates by (tenant_id, event_id), enforces per-tenant rate limits via Redis, and enriches with a risk score from an internal API. Route clean events to BigQuery tables analytics.tenants.{tenant}.events and push failed events to a dead-letter bucket with exponential backoff retries. Describe IAM, testing, and observability considerations, and how you would scale to thousands of tenants and events per second?</title>
