  <title>Design an Android module for a messaging app that delivers messages primarily through device-to-device P2P (Nearby Connections or WebRTC data channels) when devices are in proximity, with seamless server fallback. Requirements: Kotlin, Coroutines, Room-based offline log, per-device keys stored in Android Keystore with nightly rotation, and a WorkManager-based reconciliation when online. Define data model, conflict resolution, and a concrete test plan for proximity churn, out-of-order delivery, and offline queues?</title>
