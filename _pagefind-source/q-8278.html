  <title>Design a privacy-preserving, drift-aware real-time pricing system for a ride-hailing platform (high-frequency demand, region-based pricing) that must adapt within seconds, preserve user privacy with DP/FL, and support regulatory explainability. Provide data schema, feature store design, model choice (2-stage: temporal embeddings + fast ensemble), training pipeline, evaluation plan, rollout, and rollback strategy, with latency target and failure modes?</title>
