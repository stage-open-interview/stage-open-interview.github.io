  <title>Design a pluggable policy-based access control (PBAC) system where authorization decisions can be extended at runtime by adding new policy evaluation strategies (e.g., RBAC, ABAC, context-aware) without recompiling services. Describe minimal interfaces, a registry, and how you would ensure consistency across distributed services. Include a concrete usage example showing how a new policy type is registered and evaluated?</title>
