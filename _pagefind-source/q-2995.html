  <title>Design a speculative execution layer for a real-time collaborative editor where user actions arrive as a DAG of edits with dependencies. Implement a multithreaded executor that runs independent edits in parallel, defers dependents until prerequisites finish, and detects conflicts on the same position to rollback. Include a bounded replay queue to cap work and a rollback protocol. Provide a runnable sketch in Go or Rust and discuss guarantees?</title>
