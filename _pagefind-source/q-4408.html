  <title>Design a KCA workflow to issue ephemeral code-signing certificates for CI/CD runners across multiple cloud accounts. Each runner boots with a hardware-backed root and attestation, enrolls a CSR, and obtains a short-lived signing cert from a central CA. Bind signing policies to per-repo SPIFFE IDs, enable cross-account trust, renew on runner lifecycle events, revoke via OCSP/CRLs, support offline root fallback, provide auditing, and outline a concrete 1-page test plan?</title>
