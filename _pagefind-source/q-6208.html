  <title>You&#039;re designing a global, multi-tenant fraud-detection pipeline on Azure. Ingest 100k events/sec via Event Hubs, process with Databricks Spark into Delta Lake on ADLS Gen2, enforce per-tenant isolation (schema or partitioning), run a real-time scoring model, and expose an API to fetch recent scores with provenance. How would you architect data layout, model deployment, governance, testing, and failover to meet latency and isolation targets?</title>
