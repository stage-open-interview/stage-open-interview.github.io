  <title>Scenario: A 4-mic wearable in a moving vehicle captures two speakers plus ambient engine noise with non-stationary propagation. Design a hybrid ICA pipeline that uses a small neural prior to seed the online demixer and then updates in real time. Include: (i) how the neural prior is trained and used to initialize W, (ii) rules for switching between per-bin ICA and joint diagonalization, (iii) update cadence, (iv) dropout and burst frame handling, (v) evaluation plan with ground-truth sources and room impulse responses, and latency targets?</title>
