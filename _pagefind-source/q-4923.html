  <title>In a high-throughput streaming service, multiple producers publish events across distinct topics to a shared bounded buffer. Design a dispatcher in Rust that routes events to per-topic worker pools using a single ring buffer. Include per-topic offsets, backpressure when full, fair scheduling, and a clean shutdown.
