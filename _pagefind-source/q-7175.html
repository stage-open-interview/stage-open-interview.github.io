  <title>Scenario: A Linux host runs a Redis service behind a reverse proxy. During bursts, write latency tails spike even though CPU, memory, and network look normal. Using only default tooling, outline a concrete diagnostic workflow to (1) confirm if I/O wait or CPU is the bottleneck, (2) pinpoint the disk IO pattern and the process driving it, and (3) apply a safe mitigation (e.g., switch IO scheduler, adjust Redis fsync, or buffer writes) while preserving observability. Include exact commands and sample outputs?</title>
