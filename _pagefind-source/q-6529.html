  <title>You&#039;re building a global fraud-detection pipeline in Snowflake: raw.transactions (txn_id STRING, user_id STRING, amount NUMBER, currency STRING, country STRING, device_id STRING, ts TIMESTAMP_NTZ, metadata VARIANT). Ingest from 6 regions via Snowpipe; design end-to-end near real-time risk scoring that updates every minute, with dashboards showing (a) high-risk transactions in last 5 minutes and (b) average risk by region. Propose data model (RAW vs CURATED), streaming vs batch, retention, and rollback plan, with exact SQL commands to set up streams and tasks and a small rolling-risk query for validation?</title>
