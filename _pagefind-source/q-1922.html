  <title>CKAD intermediate: In a prod namespace, a Deployment named &#039;orders-api&#039; with 3 replicas experiences brief outages during image upgrades. Provide a concrete patch for zero-downtime upgrades: set rollingUpdate strategy (maxUnavailable: 0, maxSurge: 1), add a PreStop hook for graceful shutdown, and create a PodDisruptionBudget to protect at least 2 healthy pods during maintenance. Include minimal Deployment and PDB manifests and describe validation under maintenance-like load?</title>
