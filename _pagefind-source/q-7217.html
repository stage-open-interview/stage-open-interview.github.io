  <title>In a real-time fraud-detection pipeline, you deploy a TensorFlow 2.x ensemble behind TensorFlow Serving on Kubernetes. The ensemble includes a text encoder and a numeric feature subnet, with a gating head that produces the final score. Inference latency must stay under 40 ms at the 99th percentile during bursts. Describe your end-to-end design: model signatures for multi-input routing, per-request feature imputation, dynamic batching, and model versioning with canary deployments; plus observability. Include a minimal code sketch for the Serving signature and a small wrapper showing input preprocessing?</title>
