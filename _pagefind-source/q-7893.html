  <title>You&#039;re evaluating a mobile app feature that runs an on-device voice assistant for task completion. All audio processing and NL processing happens on-device; updates arrive as small patch deltas without re-downloading the full model. Build an 18-month CBA: model size targets, per-utterance CPU/memory, end-to-end latency, energy impact, local telemetry/storage, patch update costs, data-minimization/regulatory costs, and go/no-go criteria with a break-even horizon. Include a staged regional rollout and rollback plan?</title>
