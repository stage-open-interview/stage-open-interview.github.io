  <title>In a streaming 32-channel financial data feed (price, volume, spread) representing latent market factors, design a real-time online convolutive ICA pipeline to separate latent sources that drift with regime changes. Outline whitening, demixing updates, and how you would handle nonstationary mixing and cross-band permutation in the time-frequency domain, plus a practical evaluation plan with synthetic ground-truth sources?</title>
