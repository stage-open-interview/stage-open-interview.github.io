  <title>Design a high-throughput event processor where dozens of producers publish events across many tenants. A single bounded global queue feeds a small worker pool. Each tenant’s events must be delivered in-per-tenant order, while events across tenants may interleave. Propose a concrete Go or Rust design using per-tenant FIFOs and a central arbiter, with backpressure, fault tolerance, and a test strategy to verify ordering and throughput under burst?</title>
