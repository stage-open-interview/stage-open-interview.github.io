  <title>Design an online ICA pipeline for a heterogeneous sensor suite consisting of 12 microphones and 6 accelerometers with different sampling rates and intermittent data gaps on a factory floor. The pipeline must synchronize streams, whiten data, adapt a time-varying demixing matrix to nonstationary mixing, handle cross-modal mixing and channel dropout, and resolve permutation/scale ambiguities across modalities. Include latency targets, evaluation plan with ground truth, and a concrete dataflow outline?</title>
