  <title>You&#039;re deploying a real-time fraud-detection model for a fintech mobile app. The model runs on SageMaker in a VPC with PrivateLink to a private data lake; input features come from a streaming Kinesis feed. Latency target: 250 ms at 1k requests/sec; budget: $40/day. Propose: (1) model choice and feature handling to minimize cold-start and data transfer, (2) endpoint sizing and autoscaling policy (min/max, target latency, cooldown), (3) a canary rollout strategy with per-tenant routing, (4) a monitoring and retraining plan including SageMaker Model Monitor, drift checks, and alerting, (5) data residency assurances?</title>
