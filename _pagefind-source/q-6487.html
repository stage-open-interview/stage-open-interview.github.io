  <title>Design an intermediate interview scenario: a GCP multi-tenant SaaS uses Cloud Run as API gateway, Cloud SQL PostgreSQL for tenant data, and a vendor integration layer running in Cloud Functions. A vendor service account is compromised and attempts cross-tenant data access. Propose a defense-in-depth plan to prevent cross-tenant access and contain the breach quickly. Include concrete IAM bindings and conditions, per-tenant network boundaries with Private Service Connect and VPC Service Controls, data isolation at the database layer (Row-Level Security), audit and alert configuration, and an automated containment/rollback playbook with synthetic tenants for validation?</title>
