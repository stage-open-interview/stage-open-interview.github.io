  <title>Design an asyncio-based Python data processor that ingests NDJSON lines from an AsyncIterable[str], where each line contains tenant_id, ts, and payload. Implement per-tenant in-order processing with bounded buffering: a dedicated, single consumer per tenant and a global memory cap. Include a dynamic rate limiter that adjusts per-tenant buffer limits based on overall load and propagates backpressure to the source. Provide a compact test scaffold with two tenants and mixed burstiness?</title>
