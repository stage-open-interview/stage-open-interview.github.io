  <title>You&#039;re given an n x m grid. Each cell (i, j) has a color c[i][j] in [0, C-1] and a non-negative cost w[i][j]. Start at (0,0) and move to (n-1,m-1) with only right or down moves. You must visit at least one cell of every color that appears in the grid along your path. Return the minimum total cost to do so, or -1 if impossible. Describe a DP using dp[i][j][mask] where mask tracks visited colors; explain base cases, transitions from top/left, how to reconstruct the path, and complexity?</title>
