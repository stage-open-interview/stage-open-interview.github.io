  <title>Scenario: You run a 3-replica MongoDB replica set as a StatefulSet on Kubernetes. You must upgrade MongoDB from 4.4 to 5.0 with zero downtime. How would you orchestrate the upgrade using StatefulSet RollingUpdate (with partition) to upgrade secondaries first, ensure data durability, and then upgrade the primary? Include validation steps and how to keep traffic available during the upgrade?</title>
