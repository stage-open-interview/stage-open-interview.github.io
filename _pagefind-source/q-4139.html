  <title>In a microservice health policy, four services A, B, C, D can be Up, Down, or Unknown. Over two time steps t=0 and t=1, constraints: 1) If A is Up at t=0, then B is Up at t=1; 2) If D is Unknown at t=0, then B is Up at t=1 or C is Down at t=1; 3) If B is Down at t=0, then A is Down at t=1; 4) At each time t, at least one service is Unknown. Is there an assignment for (A, B, C, D) at t=0 and t=1 that satisfies all constraints with at least one Unknown at each time? Propose a 3-valued backtracking propagation approach to verify arbitrary such policy sets?</title>
