  <title>You&#039;re deploying a beginner-friendly sentiment-analysis model for customer reviews in a private AWS environment. Training data resides in a cross-account private S3 bucket; access is via a cross-account role and PrivateLink to a data lake. Propose a minimal pipeline: preprocessing in SageMaker Data Wrangler, a training job (logistic regression or built-in algorithm), host as a SageMaker endpoint with endpoint autoscaling (min 1, max 3), and a basic validation plan (accuracy, precision/recall, latency under 300 ms for 50 req/s). Ensure data never leaves VPC and cost under $15/day?</title>
