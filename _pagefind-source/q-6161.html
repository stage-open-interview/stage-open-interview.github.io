  <title>Context: A Meta/PayPal/Apple-scale platform uses a single identity service across mobile and web apps; a compromised third-party SDK could leak an access token that is usable across tenants due to insufficient audience binding. Propose a practical, production-grade security plan to prevent cross-tenant access, covering: per-tenant audience constraints and token introspection, PKCE for mobile clients, device-bound tokens with attestation, API gateway/service mesh isolation, CI checks for misconfig, and a 6-hour IR playbook with measurable success criteria?</title>
