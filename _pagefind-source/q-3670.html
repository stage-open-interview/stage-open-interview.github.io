  <title>KCNA: Design a tenant-scoped encryption model for KCNA events where each tenant&#039;s data is encrypted at rest with a per-tenant KEK sourced from a KMS, and payloads are envelope-encrypted with per-tenant DEKs that are rotated without downtime. Explain provisioning, rotation, revocation, audit proofs, and isolation guarantees under load. Include performance trade-offs and a concrete failure scenario?</title>
