  <title>In a three-region deployment of a WebRTC-based collaboration feature with TURN relays and enterprise firewalls, users report intermittent 2–5s stalls during peak hours. No app changes allowed. Provide a concrete diagnostic plan to distinguish (a) ICE connectivity checks stuck behind NAT/firewall, (b) TURN relay queueing/overload, (c) UDP multiplexing/packet pacing affecting media, with exact commands and data to collect, and propose a mitigation preserving end-to-end encryption?</title>
