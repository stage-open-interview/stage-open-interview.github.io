  <title>Design an advanced, scalable, tenant-aware analytics pipeline on Google Cloud for a SaaS product that streams events from many tenants. Ingest via Pub/Sub, process with Dataflow (Python), and write per-tenant results to a shared BigQuery dataset. Enforce access with BigQuery Row-Level Security and IAM Conditions, and export per-tenant aggregates to dedicated Cloud Storage buckets via signed URLs. Include per-tenant isolation, least-privilege IAM, auditability, rollback, and a testing strategy. How would you approach end-to-end?</title>
