  <title>Design a beginner-friendly exercise for a microservices backend role: You have an Order service (creates orders), an Inventory service (manages stock), and a Payment service. Implement a simple saga using events and an orchestrator: when an order is placed, reserve inventory, then process payment; if payment fails, release inventory; if inventory is insufficient, cancel order. How would you model the event stream and state transitions?</title>
