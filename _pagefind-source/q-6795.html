  <title>Design an AWS-native data ingestion and processing pipeline for a multi-tenant SaaS that streams petabytes of telemetry from per-tenant devices to a centralized data lake on S3. The catch: you must support upserts and deletes, low-latency queries for dashboards, per-tenant data residency, and cost controls. Propose a data layout using Apache Hudi or Iceberg on S3, with Glue Catalog integration, Athena/Redshift Spectrum for querying, and a schema evolution strategy, along with testing, monitoring, and failure handling?</title>
