  <title>You operate a multi-tenant analytics platform where each tenant&#039;s data resides in a dedicated S3 bucket within their own AWS account, while a centralized processing account runs a Lambda ETL pipeline that reads tenant data, writes results to a central data lake, and emits audit events to an immutable log store. Design a security model to ensure strict tenant isolation, least privilege, and tamper‑evident logs. Include: cross‑account IAM roles and trust policies, Organizations SCPs to enforce least privilege, per‑tenant CMKs with rotation in a Security account, bucket policies and VPC endpoints, SQS/Lambda permissions, CloudTrail integrity controls, drift detection, and a test plan for no data leakage. Explain the steps you would take?</title>
