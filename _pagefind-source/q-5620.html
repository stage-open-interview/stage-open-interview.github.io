  <title>You&#039;re deploying a high-traffic payment API named payline on Cloud Run v2 behind a Global HTTP(S) Load Balancer. Implement a JWT-claim-driven canary where the JWT tenant claim selects routing: if tenant is A route to v3 at 15% for 20 minutes; otherwise route to v2. After 20 minutes, ramp to 60% for tenant A and full traffic for all tenants if SLOs are met (p95 latency &lt;= 0.9s and error rate &lt;= 0.2%). Use only Google-native tools. Provide exact steps: build and push v3 to Artifact Registry, create per-tenant serverless NEGs, configure a URL map with JWT-based routing, set monitoring alerts, and implement rollback by routing all traffic back to v2; include minimal IAM roles and Secrets/CMEK handling?</title>
