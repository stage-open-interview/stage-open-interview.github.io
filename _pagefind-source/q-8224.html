  <title>Scenario: A Linux host with 2 NUMA nodes runs a latency-sensitive service and a background job. During bursts, tail latency spikes and cross-node memory traffic appears. Using only default tools, design a concrete diagnostic workflow to (1) confirm NUMA memory bandwidth contention as the cause, (2) map per-thread NUMA placement, and (3) apply safe mitigation (bind the service to one node, fix CPU affinity, or adjust memory policy) while preserving observability. Include exact commands and outputs?</title>
