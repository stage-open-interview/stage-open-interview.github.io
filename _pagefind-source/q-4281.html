  <title>Scenario: A multi-tenant SaaS platform hosts user-contributed ML model plugins that load at runtime in isolation. Design a concrete plan to sign each model artifact (e.g., .onnx, .pt) and its metadata with cosign, publish attestations to Rekor, and enforce at load time that only attested models are accepted by the model loader. Include concrete signing commands, attestation storage layout, and a sample OPA policy and loader integration steps?</title>
