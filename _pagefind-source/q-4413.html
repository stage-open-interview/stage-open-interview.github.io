  <title>Design a dynamic 2D point set supporting insertPoint(x, y) and erasePoint(x, y) (duplicates allowed). Implement two queries: nearestNeighbor(x0, y0) returning the closest point to (x0, y0), and kNearestNeighbors(x0, y0, k) returning the k closest points. Optimize for practical performance with insertions and deletions; discuss using a dynamic KD-tree with lazy deletions and rebuild strategy, how to handle duplicates with unique IDs, and expected amortized costs in practice?</title>
