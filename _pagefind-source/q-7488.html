  <title>Design and implement an asynchronous Python data pipeline that ingests NDJSON events from an async source, validates each event via a Pydantic model, then enriches events by querying a rate-limited REST API. Route events by &#039;tenant&#039; so per-tenant events are processed in order, with per-tenant buffers limited to a maximum size and total memory under a defined budget. The pipeline must apply backpressure to the producer, handle transient API errors with exponential backoff, and support graceful shutdown. Provide data models, components, and a minimal test plan?</title>
