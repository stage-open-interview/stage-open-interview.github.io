  <title>Design a beginner-friendly E2E test for a feature-flag controlled onboarding tour in a web app. The tour should render only when a per-user flag is enabled; otherwise it should be skipped. Outline how you would isolate test data, mock the flag service, verify the UI steps, and validate that telemetry events fire on tour start and completion. Include how you’d prevent cross-test data leakage in a shared staging environment and which tools (Playwright or Cypress) you would use?</title>
