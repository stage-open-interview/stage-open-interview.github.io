  <title>You&#039;re building a multi-tenant IoT telemetry platform: ~1k devices/min send data to Azure IoT Hub, routed to real-time analytics in Spark on Azure Synapse, with per-tenant data isolation in Cosmos DB and dashboards behind a shared API gateway. Design end-to-end architecture with Private Endpoints, Azure Lighthouse for cross-tenant access, and Terraform/GitHub Actions CI/CD. Include data retention, security, cost controls, and a regional failover plan. How would you implement?</title>
