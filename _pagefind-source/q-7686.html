  <title>Design an Azure DevOps release pipeline to deploy a multi-tenant microservice to two AKS clusters (East US and West Europe) using Helm charts with per-tenant namespaces. Implement per-environment secrets from Azure Key Vault, enforce policy approvals, and perform staged canary traffic shifts (10/90 then 25/75) via Istio or Kubernetes traffic routing. Include post-deploy drift checks with kubectl diff against the last release, auto-rollback to the previous Helm release on failure, and audit all steps to Log Analytics. What would your pipeline look like?</title>
