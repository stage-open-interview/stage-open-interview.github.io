  <title>You&#039;re building an Android field tool app used by technicians to annotate images and run on-device ML for scene classification with offline-first data collection. The app must train a lightweight model locally from user-labeled samples, support incremental model updates delivered from the backend, and handle intermittent connectivity. Design end-to-end architecture and data flow using Room, DataStore, WorkManager, and TensorFlow Lite. Address offline training, model versioning, delta updates, rollback, and testing under Doze and flaky networks?</title>
