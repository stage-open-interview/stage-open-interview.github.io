  <title>You&#039;re implementing a Terraform platform that must provision resources in both AWS and GCP for different tenants, with a centralized &#039;infra-core&#039; repo for shared networking and IAM and per-tenant &#039;services-app&#039; repos. A new requirement is multi-cloud support with per-tenant provider aliasing, read-only cross-cloud IDs surfaced via remote state, and per-tenant isolation enforced by CI policy gates. Outline a concrete approach with provider alias blocks, cross-repo data sources, and a gate design; include a minimal patch snippet to illustrate alias usage and a sample policy fragment?</title>
