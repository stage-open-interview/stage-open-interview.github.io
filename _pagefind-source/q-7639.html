  <title>You&#039;re responsible for a critical data platform used by six product squads across geographies. A regulatory change requires all PII to move into a new data enclave with strict access controls, but the migration could cause a 4–6 week feature freeze and risk service disruption. Design a practical plan that (a) coordinates governance across teams, security, and product, (b) assesses risk and mitigations, (c) delivers a phased migration with minimal latency impact, (d) defines success metrics and rollback criteria, and (e) communicates progress to executives and stakeholders.
