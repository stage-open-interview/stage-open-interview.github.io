  <title>Two squads share a single API surface: Platform Reliability (2 senior + 1 mid) and Growth Feature (4 engineers). Platform incidents increased MTTR by 40% last quarter; Growth feature is 70% complete but depends on unstable APIs and tight external deadlines. How would you structure quarterly planning to protect reliability, reallocate capacity, set SLOs and error budgets, and implement gating (flags, canaries, contracts) to finish the Growth feature without amplifying risk?</title>
