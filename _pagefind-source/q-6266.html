  <title>In a two-site network (Site A and Site B) connected by VPN, api.example.com is reachable from Site A but not from Site B. DNS for api.example.com recently changed to a new IP, but Site B still resolves to the old IP. Provide a concrete, beginner-friendly diagnostic plan to verify (a) DNS resolution behavior from both sites (dig/nslookup, +trace, TTLs), (b) whether DNS caching or zone delegation is stale, (c) network reachability to both old and new IPs with traceroute and curl, and (d) edge firewall/NAT rules affecting outbound DNS/IP. Propose practical mitigations to restore service quickly?</title>
