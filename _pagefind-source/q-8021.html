  <title>Scenario: In a Consul Connect mesh across DC-west and DC-east, a cross-DC service &#039;shipping&#039; on DC-west calls &#039;inventory&#039; on DC-east. DNS resolves but requests fail with 403 unless a specific ACL token is present. Design an end-to-end workflow to determine if the issue is WAN federation identity propagation, ACL token scoping across DCs, or cross-DC service registration/intent mismatches. Include commands and rollback steps?</title>
