  <title>In a tiny temporal logic puzzle, you have four signals S1..S4. Each signal at each time step t ∈ {0,1,2} can take values {T, F, U}. Constraints (for t ∈ {0,1}):
- If S1(t) = T then S2(t+1) ≠ F
- If S3(t) = F then S4(t+1) = T
- If S2(t) = U then S1(t+1) = U
Is there a trace of length 3 (t = 0..2) with at least one U that makes none of the constraints evaluate to F at any time? Outline a 3-valued temporal propagation/backtracking approach and provide a small example walk-through?</title>
