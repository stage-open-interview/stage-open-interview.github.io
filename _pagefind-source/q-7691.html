  <title>In a multi-region Aurora PostgreSQL Global Database with a writer in us-east-1 and a secondary in eu-west-1, two tenants share the same logical schema but require strict per-tenant isolation. Design a solution to give TenantB near real-time dashboards in eu-west-1 while writes occur in us-east-1. Use RLS for tenant isolation, IAM database authentication, and cross-region replication settings. Include (1) per-tenant access controls, (2) replication topology and read latency targets, (3) backup/DR plan with RPO/RTO, (4) validation steps to verify isolation and latency?</title>
