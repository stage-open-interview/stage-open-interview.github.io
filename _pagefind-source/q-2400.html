  <title>Scenario: A multi-tenant e-commerce platform (Airbnb-like) processes guest and host data in a centralized data lake on AWS. A new data export feature allows hosts to download their own booking data as CSV; misconfigured IAM/bucket policy could leak other tenants&#039; data. Propose a beginner-friendly security plan to enforce least privilege using IAM roles, S3 bucket policies, and KMS, add a CI gate to block secrets in code, and draft a 48-hour IR playbook for credential leakage or cross-tenant exposure; include concrete steps, tooling, and success metrics?</title>
