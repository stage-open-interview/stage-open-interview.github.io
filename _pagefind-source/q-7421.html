  <title>You operate an 8-mic array on a moving delivery robot, streaming to edge with ~100 ms latency. Design a real-time online convolutive ICA pipeline that handles moving talkers and non-stationary HVAC/noise. Include: (i) sliding-window whitening with forgetting factor, (ii) per-bin ICA vs joint diagonalization decision, (iii) cross-band permutation tracking via envelope cues, (iv) a lightweight wind-noise prefilter, (v) update cadence and latency targets, (vi) evaluation plan with ground-truth sources and dynamic room effects?</title>
