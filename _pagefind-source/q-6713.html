  <title>You&#039;re building an AWS AI pipeline for user-submitted code snippets (≤150 KB). On S3 upload, design an event-driven flow that uses a SageMaker hosted static analysis model for vulnerability detection, a lightweight NLP classifier to assign risk categories, and a policy-enforcement step to block deployment if the riskScore exceeds a threshold. Store verdicts in S3 as verdict.json and summary.json, and upsert a DynamoDB index with codeId, s3Key, language, riskScore, analyzerVersion, policyAction. Include IAM, error handling, privacy, and cost considerations?</title>
