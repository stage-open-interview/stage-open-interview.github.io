  <title>Describe an end-to-end approach to serving a large, custom-op-augmented Transformer model in TensorFlow Serving on Kubernetes, where a novel attention op is implemented in C++. Include how to build and register the custom op, ensure ABI compatibility across TF versions, handle multi-arch containers, and achieve zero-downtime model updates with per-version traffic splitting. Also mention monitoring for numerical drift and latency?</title>
