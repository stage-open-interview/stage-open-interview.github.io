  <title>Design a cross-region, multi-account CI/CD for a serverless microservice deployed as AWS Lambda behind API Gateway, using GitHub Actions to deploy CDK stacks to two regions. Implement progressive canary by routing 10-20% of traffic to the new version via a Lambda alias weight, with automatic rollback on CloudWatch latency/errors. Include least-privilege roles and cross-account trust, folder structure, and a minimal CDK snippet?</title>
