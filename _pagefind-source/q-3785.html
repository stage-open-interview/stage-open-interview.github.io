  <title>You’re building a privacy-preserving, explainable cca_score API for a multi-tenant app where some tenants require differential privacy and strict data residency. The API must return a per-user score plus a concise explanation that does not reveal training data or model internals, while enforcing tenant isolation and model_versioning. Describe the API surface (endpoints and payloads), the data model, privacy controls (masking, differential privacy), and a testing plan including explainability fidelity and privacy risk assessment. Include a simple flow diagram and a sample canary test scenario?</title>
