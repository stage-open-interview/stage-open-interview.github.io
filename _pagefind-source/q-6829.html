  <title>Design a beginner-level Azure OpenAI-powered support assistant for a SaaS product that runs behind API Management and grounds answers against a versioned KB stored in Azure Blob via Azure Cognitive Search. Add a new angle: implement a simple circuit-breaker and a per-tenant TTL cache to avoid repeated OpenAI calls, and to gracefully degrade when OpenAI is rate-limited or unavailable. Outline end-to-end data paths, components, and a minimal test plan; include a concrete cache design and how it interacts with KB grounding?</title>
