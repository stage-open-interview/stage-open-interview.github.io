  <title>You&#039;re building a beginner-friendly per-user cca_score API for a mobile app used worldwide. Design a minimal, region-aware scoring service with a 2-feature linear model, cache results in Redis (TTL 15m), and deduplicate requests via a request_id. Use Postgres for user features, gate features by region to meet privacy rules, and keep writes idempotent. Provide endpoints, data schemas, and a simple test plan with canary rollout, clock skew, and backfill considerations?</title>
