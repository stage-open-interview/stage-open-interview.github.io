  <title>In a two-account AWS-SAP deployment (prod and non-prod) with SAP HANA on EC2, design a per-environment data access governance workflow that prevents cross-environment data exposure and enforces data residency. Requirements: map SAP authorizations to IAM roles and SCPs per environment; implement runtime data masking for non-prod users; capture immutable access logs by combining SAP audit logs and CloudTrail to S3; provide a minimal CloudFormation snippet to create the cross-account role and a guardrail Lambda that validates access requests before reaching SAP. Include concrete resource names and permissions?</title>
