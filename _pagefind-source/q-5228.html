  <title>You&#039;re building a microservice that fetches product catalog data from multiple partner APIs. Implement an asynchronous fetcher in Python that accepts a list of (domain, endpoint) pairs and returns a per-domain rate-limited, memory-bounded stream of results. Requirements: per-domain concurrency limit (e.g., 2 concurrent requests per domain), robust retry with exponential backoff and jitter for transient HTTP errors, a timeout cap for the global operation, and a memory-friendly aggregator that yields each product as soon as arrived (no full in-memory merge). Provide a minimal runnable example using httpx or aiohttp and a simple test plan with simulated domains and failure modes?</title>
