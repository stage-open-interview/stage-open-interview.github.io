  <title>Design an asynchronous Python engine to join two JSON event streams by id within a 5-second window. Streams A and B are async iterables yielding {&#039;id&#039;: str, &#039;ts&#039;: int, &#039;payload&#039;: Any}. Emit matched pairs to a sink when both sides have an event with same id within the 5s window. Route late events past the lateness bound to a &#039;late&#039; sink. Enforce a global memory bound for buffered events and propose a test plan with out-of-order arrivals?</title>
