  <title>In a 4-channel EEG headset recording a brief resting-state session, design a beginner ICA pipeline to separate neural components from ocular and EMG artifacts. Outline: whitening, choice between real-valued FastICA or Infomax, frame-wise vs block-wise ICA with permutation alignment across windows, online adaptation for impedance drift, and a practical evaluation plan using simulated ground truth sources and known event-related potentials?</title>
