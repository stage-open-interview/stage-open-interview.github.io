  <title>You&#039;re building a cross-tenant incident routing system integrating Salesforce and Slack events into an Azure-driven workflow. Ingest events from Salesforce and Slack via Azure Event Hubs (peak ~60k msgs/sec), deduplicate, and route to per-tenant queues. Orchestrate triage with Durable Functions, persist state in Cosmos DB (tenantId as PartitionKey), and log auditable trails. How would you design for latency, fault tolerance, data residency, idempotency, and end-to-end observability across services?</title>
