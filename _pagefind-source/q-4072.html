  <title>You&#039;re adding an asynchronous background job system to a high-traffic web app (Django + Celery + Redis). During a marketing burst, enqueue rate jumps 5x and the worker queue grows. How would you design a beginner-friendly performance test to measure end-to-end latency from enqueue to completion, detect backpressure, and validate autoscaling of workers? Include a concrete test plan, metrics, and how you&#039;d isolate enqueue vs processing?</title>
