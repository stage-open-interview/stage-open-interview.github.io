  <title>Design a Snowflake-based near real-time anomaly-detection pipeline for telemetry events. Ingested table: raw_events(device_id STRING, ts TIMESTAMP_NTZ, payload VARIANT). Ingests 200M+ rows/day. You need to detect spikes in a metric inside payload (e.g., latency) on a per-device basis with a 5-minute window and surface alerts to an alerts table when a spike exceeds a dynamic threshold. Describe the architecture using Streams, Tasks, and possibly a Snowflake procedure; include DDLs to create the stream, a task schedule, sample SQL for the rolling compute, and how you would validate the pipeline end-to-end?</title>
