  <title>Design an Azure data engineering pipeline for streaming IoT telemetry from store sensors into ADLS Gen2 and Synapse, with schema drift tolerant transformations, incremental loads, and end-to-end data lineage. Use Event Hubs to ADLS Gen2, Delta Lake in Synapse, and Purview for lineage. Address late data, schema evolution, security, and cross-region replication. What services and data contracts would you implement, and how would you validate correctness?</title>
