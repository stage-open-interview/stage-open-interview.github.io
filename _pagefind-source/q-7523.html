  <title>In a two-region deployment (US-East, EU-Central) hosting a regional analytics API behind a global DNS and regional load balancers, EU clients intermittently resolve to US endpoints during peak hours. No app changes. Provide a concrete diagnostic plan to determine whether (a) DNS TTL/cache behavior, (b) geolocation-based DNS routing rules, or (c) edge LB health checks are to blame, with exact commands and data to collect, and propose mitigations that keep region-local endpoints stable?</title>
