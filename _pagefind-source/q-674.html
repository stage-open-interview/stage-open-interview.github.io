  <title>You&#039;re building an AWS DVA data-analytics pipeline ingesting telemetry from 2000 devices/sec via Kinesis Data Streams. A Spark/Glue path processes windows and writes Parquet to S3; aggregation state in DynamoDB. Data loss or duplicates occur during retries and outages; costs spike at peak. Design a resilient, cost-efficient approach: shard sizing, processing path, idempotent writes, error handling with DLQ, and observability. What would you implement and why?</title>
