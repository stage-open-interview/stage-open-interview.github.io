  <title>Design a beginner-friendly cross-VPC DNS solution in a two-VPC, single-region setup: VPC-A and VPC-B each host a simple app; a Shared Services VPC hosts a private Analytics API analytics.api.internal. Enable private DNS resolution across VPCs without VPC peering, so services in A and B resolve analytics.api.internal to the Shared Services endpoint. Describe Route 53 Resolver outbound/inbound endpoints, private hosted zone, resolver rules, security groups, and a brief trade-off analysis between VPC peering and Resolver-based DNS?</title>
