  <title>Design a rate limiting service that can handle 10 million requests per second with distributed consistency across multiple data centers. The service should support multiple rate limiting strategies (token bucket, sliding window, fixed window) and provide sub-millisecond latency. How would you architect this to handle bursts, prevent thundering herd problems, and ensure accurate global rate limits?</title>
