  <title>Ingest 100k protobuf events/sec from mobile devices across 5 regions. Events are nested and evolve with new types. Design an end-to-end streaming pipeline to Iceberg with per-record contracts, region isolation, and idempotent MERGE upserts; handle late data up to 15 minutes; emit per-event lineage; include basic data-quality gates and schema evolution. Compare Spark Structured Streaming vs Flink and outline testing/monitoring?</title>
