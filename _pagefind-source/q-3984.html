  <title>Design an advanced real-time data feed in a cross-platform React Native app (Meta/Microsoft level). The UI must render live stock prices for 200 symbols with updates every 50–100 ms. Explain end-to-end: native bridge architecture (TurboModule/Fabric vs legacy bridge), threading model for decoding, memory management, and how you would push updates to JS with minimal GC pressure. Include a concise outline of a hook like useLivePrices(symbols) and a small testing plan?</title>
