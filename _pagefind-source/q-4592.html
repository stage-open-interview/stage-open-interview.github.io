  <title>Scenario: A SaaS vendor streams daily JSON events into a central S3 data lake across accounts. Data arrives with nested fields and occasional new keys. Design an end-to-end ingestion and governance plan to land data as Apache Iceberg tables in S3 (partitioned by event_date), with schema evolution via Glue Schema Registry, and upserts for dedup by (customer_id, event_id). Include ingestion path, late-arriving data handling, testing plan, monitoring, and trade-offs between Iceberg vs Glue tables?</title>
