  <title>In a live esports arena with 12 microphones (wearables on players and fixed stage mics) where participants move, sources emerge and disappear and reverberation is high, design a real-time nonlinear ICA-inspired BSS pipeline. Include: (i) a geometry-conditioned neural demixer with frame-based processing, (ii) online whitening and stable updates, (iii) dynamic demixing matrices conditioned on real-time geometry, (iv) handling of source emergence/dropout and variable channel quality, (v) latency target and an evaluation plan using ground-truth or high-fidelity synthetic data?</title>
