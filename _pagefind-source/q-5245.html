  <title>Design a real-time ingestion and analytics pipeline on GCP for a fintech product that streams transaction events from Pub/Sub into BigQuery. Requirements: multi-tenant isolation with per-tenant BigQuery datasets and Row-Level Security on tenant_id; data residency restricted to US regions; a streaming Dataflow job that validates events and routes malformed ones to a DLQ in Cloud Storage; support for backward-compatible schema evolution via a central Registry; cost-conscious design with partitioning and clustering by tenant_id/event_ts; rollback by reverting to previous schema and replaying DLQ; observability via Cloud Monitoring and Logging with a correlation_id. Provide a concrete architecture and key trade-offs?</title>
