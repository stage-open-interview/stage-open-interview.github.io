  <title>Two worker threads share a single io_uring instance and submit I/O to the same file descriptor concurrently. Describe a concrete interleaving where two threads call io_uring_get_sqe() and io_uring_submit() in overlapping fashion, racing the tail pointer and potentially losing a submission or delivering out-of-order completions. What exact synchronization and memory-barrier guarantees are required to ensure atomic reservation of SQEs, and how would you structure code to guarantee in-order completions for logging while preserving high throughput?</title>
