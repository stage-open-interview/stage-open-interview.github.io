  <title>You&#039;re releasing v3 of a Cloud Run (fully managed) service named file-indexer that triggers a Cloud Tasks worker per file. Using only Google-native tools, implement a canary: 10% traffic to v3 for 25 minutes with automatic rollback to v2 if p95 ingestion latency to Cloud Tasks &gt; 1.2s for 5 minutes or queue backlog &gt; 100 tasks for 3 consecutive 5-minute windows. Include exact steps to build/push v3 to Artifact Registry, configure a Cloud Deploy rollout with per-revision traffic-split, set Cloud Monitoring alert policies, and rollback by shifting all traffic back to v2.
