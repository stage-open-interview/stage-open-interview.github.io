  <title>You&#039;re deploying a real-time churn-prediction service for a B2B SaaS platform on SageMaker. In addition to latency and privacy constraints, you must implement per-user explainability with SageMaker Clarify, support a Feature Store for online features, and handle seasonal data drift without downtime. Describe the architecture, data flow, scaling strategy, and a plan to validate explanations, drift alerts, and rollback. Include how you would test across regions to meet regional data isolation requirements?</title>
