Include verification that the initial response is 200 with Content-Type text/event-stream, events arrive as distinct data lines, IDs increase monotonically, and reconnection with Last-Event-ID preserves continuity; test keepalive messages and concurrent clients receiving isolated streams; provide tooling suggestions?</title>
