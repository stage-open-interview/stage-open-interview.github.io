  <title>Describe a beginner-friendly deployment for a private static frontend hosted on S3 with CloudFront using an Origin Access Identity, plus a lightweight API via API Gateway and Lambda. Explain how you would implement per-environment isolation (dev/stage/prod) with separate buckets and endpoints, enforce least-privilege IAM roles, and a simple backup/restore plan for assets. Include a minimal Lambda policy to read S3 and publish logs to CloudWatch?</title>
