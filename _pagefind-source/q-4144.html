  <title>Design a beginner-friendly concurrency pattern for a bounded multi-producer, multi-consumer router: many producers publish tasks tagged by resource_id into a shared bounded global queue. Implement per-resource FIFO buffers and a small worker pool that processes tasks from those buffers, while guaranteeing per-resource order and fair progress between resources. Explain backpressure, starvation avoidance, and a simple test plan to verify ordering under bursty loads?</title>
