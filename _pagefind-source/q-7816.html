  <title>Design a privacy-preserving, bias-auditing ML governance system on GCP for a multinational loan-application platform. The system should continuously monitor Vertex AI model predictions for disparate impact across demographic groups, use differential privacy during training, store encrypted inference logs in Cloud Storage, and run Dataflow pipelines to aggregate metrics per country. Include data schemas, alerting thresholds, and a rollback workflow to a prior model version when bias exceeds a predefined threshold?</title>
