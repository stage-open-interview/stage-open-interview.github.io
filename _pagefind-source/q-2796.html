  <title>You&#039;re designing a globe-spanning telemetry pipeline for an industrial platform: devices push MQTT data to IoT Hub, events feed into Event Hubs at up to 200k msgs/min, Durable Functions compute windowed aggregates, and results are written to Cosmos DB with tenantId partition keys. How would you meet sub-200ms tail latency, strict per-tenant isolation, idempotent retries, cross-region reads, private endpoints, auditable traces, plus DR and cost controls?</title>
