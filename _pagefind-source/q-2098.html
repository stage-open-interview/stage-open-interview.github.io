  <title>Using TensorFlow 2.x, implement a gradient accumulation training loop inside tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy to achieve an effective batch size of 1024 with per-step batch 64 on multi-GPU. Include how you would apply loss scaling for mixed precision, and how to accumulate and apply gradients every &#039;accum_steps&#039; steps. Provide skeleton code for the train_step and train_loop, and explain memory and determinism considerations?</title>
