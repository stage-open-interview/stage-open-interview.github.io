  <title>In a two-region deployment where a cloud firewall performs TLS inspection in front of a regional API gateway, login requests intermittently spike in tail latency during peak hours while static content remains fast. Without changing app code, outline a concrete diagnostic plan to distinguish whether TLS-inspection queueing, firewall rate-limiting, or edge-cache invalidations drive the latency, including exact data to collect and realistic mitigations that preserve security?</title>
