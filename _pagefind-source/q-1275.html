  <title>Design an advanced async Python pipeline: NDJSON lines arrive via a TCP socket, each is validated with a Pydantic model, then a deduplication stage uses a sliding-window Bloom filter to emit each event at most once in a 24-hour window. The pipeline must stay memory-bounded, support backpressure to the producer, and allow the downstream sink to pace itself. Provide a concrete test plan with clock skew and bursty traffic?</title>
