  <title>You&#039;re building a real-time inference service for a multi-tenant SaaS platform used by Adobe, Zoom, and Scale AI. Each tenant has its own VPC and data lake; data must stay within the VPC and be accessible via PrivateLink. The system must meet per-tenant latency SLAs, burst traffic, and strict cost caps. Propose: (1) architecture for per-tenant routing and model versioning (shared endpoint vs fan-out); (2) per-tenant autoscaling with QoS, including metrics, min/max, and cooldowns; (3) canary rollout strategy and rollback by tenant; (4) drift detection and retraining triggers per tenant; (5) telemetry, dashboards, and per-tenant cost allocation; (6) rough 30-day cost estimate?</title>
