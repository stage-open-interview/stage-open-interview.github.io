  <title>Design a Consul Connect mesh that spans two Kubernetes clusters (prod and analytics) and an on‑prem VM fleet. A data-ingest service in prod must securely call downstream processors during business hours only, with per‑request identity binding, zero‑trust ACLs, and automatic token rotation via Vault. Explain how you&#039;d implement cross‑environment identity, time‑bound access, credential rotation without downtime, and auditability. Include concrete config excerpts for both clusters and the VM host?</title>
