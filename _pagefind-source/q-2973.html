  <title>Scenario: In an 8‑mic car cabin with moving talkers, wind noise, and nonlinear mic distortion, design a real-time convolutive ICA pipeline for an embedded GPU. Include: (i) 20 ms frames with whitening and online 8×8 demixing, (ii) a decision between per-bin ICA vs joint diagonalization, (iii) cross-bin permutation alignment, (iv) dropout robustness, and (v) an evaluation plan with ground-truth SDR/SIR and a latency target. How would you implement and validate it?</title>
