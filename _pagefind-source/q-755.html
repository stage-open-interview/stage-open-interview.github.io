  <title>You&#039;re maintaining real-time travel times in a citywide road network modeled as a weighted directed graph with nonnegative costs. Costs can only decrease as new data arrives. Design an incremental algorithm to keep the shortest-path distances from a fixed hub S to all nodes up-to-date after each edge-cost decrease, aiming for sublinear amortized update work. Provide initial SSSP complexity, amortized per-decrease update, memory usage, and practical optimization strategies?</title>
