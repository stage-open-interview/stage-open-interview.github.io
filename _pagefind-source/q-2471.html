  <title>KCNA security and governance: design a per-tenant envelope encryption scheme for KCNA payloads using a central KMS. Each tenant has a dedicated DEK wrapped by a tenant-specific KEK. Encrypt payloads at produce time and decrypt only at authorized consumers with per-tenant IAM. Support per-tenant key rotation with zero-downtime re-encryption, and maintain per-tenant audit trails and deletion rules that respect retention. How would you implement lifecycle, performance trade-offs, and backward-compatibility?</title>
