  <title>You&#039;re assessing a webhook receiver service that ingests up to 500 events/sec from a partner feed and retries failed deliveries with exponential backoff and jitter before passing payloads to a downstream processor. For a 10-minute burst, design a beginner-friendly performance test to ensure no retry storm overloading downstream, and capture latency p95, throughput, retry rate, and downstream error rate. Provide load profile, data strategy, and component isolation plan without modifying production code?</title>
