  <title>KCNA privacy-driven cross-cluster visibility: In a multi-region KCNA deployment, a privacy policy change requires tenants to have per-event visibility windows and revocation capabilities across replicated clusters. Design a system to (1) enforce per-tenant visibility windows during cross-cluster replication, (2) retract or redact events after policy change without breaking at-least-once semantics, (3) provide tamper-evident audit logs and per-tenant revocation, with rollback and observability. Outline data model, replication protocol, API contracts, and a test strategy?</title>
