  <title>In a production TensorFlow 2.x service, you need to feed a model with high-throughput image batches stored in a remote bucket. The pipeline must support deterministic preprocessing, robust caching, and minimal CPU-GPU contention. Describe how you would construct a tf.data pipeline using interleave/map with num_parallel_calls, cache, shuffle, batch, prefetch, and AUTOTUNE. Include a minimal example demonstrating the pipeline for 256x256 RGB images and explain how you would measure throughput and tune parameters?</title>
