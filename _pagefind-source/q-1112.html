  <title>Scenario: In a Databricks Delta Live Tables pipeline, ingest JSON events from a Kafka source into a Bronze table, where nested fields drift over time (e.g., payload.user.locale is added later, some events miss payload.user). You then transform to a Silver table used by billing and marketing. How would you implement a robust schema-evolution strategy and gating so new fields are captured without breaking existing downstream queries, and how would you test this in a run?</title>
