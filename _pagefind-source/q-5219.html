  <title>In a two-building campus network with a single L3 inter-VLAN router and VLAN 10/20, a new SSH management server in VLAN 20 becomes intermittently unreachable from VLAN 10 during peak hours. No apps changes. Provide a concrete diagnostic plan to determine whether (a) ARP storms or MAC table flips, (b) inter-VLAN routing path flaps, (c) trunk misconfig or ACLs, or (d) switch QoS/buffering is responsible, with exact commands and data to collect, and propose a remediation that preserves L3 reachability?</title>
