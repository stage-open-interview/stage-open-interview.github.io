  <title>Design an Azure-native, EU-resident, edge-enabled telemetry platform for a real-time messaging app used by enterprise customers (Snap, Discord, Goldman Sachs). The system must ingest client telemetry at the edge (IoT Edge or SDKs), perform regional near-real-time aggregation, keep raw data within EU borders, implement BYOK with Key Vault, and serve dashboards with sub-second latency. Compare IoT Hub vs Event Hubs, edge compute placement, DR across two EU regions, and cost levers. Include a concise migration/testing plan?</title>
