  <title>You&#039;re designing a distributed event store for a real-time financial analytics platform. Each instrument&#039;s events are sharded by instrument-id and replicated across 3 regions. Explain a concrete plan covering (1) shard design and hot-shard mitigation, (2) cross-region replication with reads and writes guarantees, (3) live shard rebalancing without data loss, and (4) disaster recovery and point-in-time restore. Include data model sketches and a small pseudo-code snippet for rebalancing?</title>
