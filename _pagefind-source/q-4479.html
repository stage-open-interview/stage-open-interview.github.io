  <title>Design a KCA-based bootstrap and certificate lifecycle for ephemeral CI/CD runners provisioned on-demand across AWS, Azure, and GCP. Runners authenticate to a central CA using hardware-backed attestation to receive short-lived TLS client certificates (TTL 300s) for mTLS inside the CI/CD mesh. Include enrollment, attestation checks, renewal on re-provision, tenant isolation, revocation via OCSP/CRLs, offline root fallback, auditing, and a minimal test plan. Provide concrete components and data flows?</title>
