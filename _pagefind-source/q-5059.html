  <title>You have four boolean-like variables X1..X4 taking values in {T, F, U}. Rules are Horn-like implications:
- (X1 = T) → (X3 = T)
- (X2 = T) → (X4 = T)
- (X3 = F) → (X1 = F)
- (X4 = F) → (X2 = F)

Your task: determine whether there exists an assignment with at least one U such that no rule evaluates to F, and provide a backtracking with forward propagation approach, including a tiny 4-variable walk-through showing a valid example?</title>
