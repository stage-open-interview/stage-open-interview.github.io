  <title>Scenario: Global telemetry ingests JSON events from 200k devices/sec across regions. In addition to a raw event lake, design a versioned feature store on top of Iceberg that materializes simple features (count per device in last 5m, mean value, recency) and keeps per-record lineage to raw events. Requirements: dynamic feature definitions with schema evolution, per-record data contracts, late data handling up to 10 minutes, idempotent upserts, TTL pruning, and per-region data isolation. Include a concrete MERGE example and a high-level monitoring plan; compare Spark Structured Streaming vs Flink for this workload?</title>
