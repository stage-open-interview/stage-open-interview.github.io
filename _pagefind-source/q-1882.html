  <title>Design a cross-region analytic path for a SaaS app with an Aurora PostgreSQL OLTP cluster in us-east-1 as the single writer and regional read replicas in us-west-2. The goal: near real-time analytics with masked PII in the analytics store. Propose a CDC-based pipeline (Aurora CDC, DMS, Debezium, or Kinesis) to load into Redshift or DynamoDB in us-west-2, choose masking strategy, encryption, data freshness target (RPO), failover plan, and cost considerations. Include concrete config choices (instance types, retention, network, and security)?</title>
