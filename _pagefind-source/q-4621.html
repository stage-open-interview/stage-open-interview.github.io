  <title>You are building a beginner TensorFlow 2.x text classifier that reads sentences from a file and labels are provided separately. How would you implement a tf.data pipeline that tokenizes each line on whitespace, maps tokens to integer IDs using a StaticVocabularyTable built from the dataset, pads sequences to a fixed length, and batches for training? Include a minimal code snippet showing vocab creation, tokenization, and batching?</title>
