  <title>Scenario: A stadium-wide 20-mic array captures a live concert with dynamic crowd noise and intermittent mic dropouts. Design an online convolutional ICA pipeline robust to channel loss and nonstationary noise. Include: (i) frame-based processing with 64-sample frames, (ii) whitening, (iii) online 20×20 demixing with a choice between per-bin ICA and joint diagonalization, (iv) cross-bin permutation alignment and dropout handling, (v) latency under 120 ms, (vi) evaluation with ground-truth sources and a field demo. How would you approach this?</title>
