  <title>You&#039;re designing a real-time anti-fraud platform for a multi-tenant fintech on Azure. Ingest 500k events/sec from payment gateways via Azure Event Hubs, process with Spark into Delta Lake on ADLS Gen2, enforce per-tenant isolation. Build ML-based scoring in Azure ML, served through AKS with an online feature store in Redis, provide SHAP explanations and drift detection. How would you design data framing, model lifecycle, observability, rollback, and cost controls?</title>
