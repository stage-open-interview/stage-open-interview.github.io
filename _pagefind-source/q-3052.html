  <title>In a two-node docker-dca Swarm, deploy a TLS-enabled stateless API behind Nginx. Use Docker secrets for TLS certs and a Docker Config named flag.json mounted at /config/flag.json. Implement a simple feature toggle in the API that reads the flag from /config/flag.json and supports hot reload via SIGHUP without restarting. Add a progressive canary rollout: enable the feature in 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% in 20-second steps with health checks and automatic rollback on failure. Provide exact docker commands and a docker-compose.yml skeleton that demonstrates the rollout. Also show how to verify latency impact during each step?</title>
