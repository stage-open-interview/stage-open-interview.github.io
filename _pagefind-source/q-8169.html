  <title>In a multi-tenant Kubernetes cluster using Cilium with eBPF policy enforcement, a new UDP telemetry stream from tenant A to a central collector intermittently drops during scale-out. No app changes. Provide a concrete diagnostic plan to determine whether (a) per-tenant BPF policy maps are evicted due to memory pressure, (b) UDP load balancing across endpoints is skewed by policy traces, (c) MTU fragmentation or GRO offload in the Cilium datapath, or (d) host NIC ring/interrupt affinity causes TX starvation, with exact commands and data to collect, and propose mitigations preserving telemetry reliability and tenant isolation?</title>
