  <title>You&#039;re building a financial compliance QA assistant for a bank that cites internal memos and public regulations. The retriever pulls from three corpora: internal memos, regulatory texts, and risk dashboards. The model sometimes fabricates section references or misquotes policies, and updates happen monthly. Design a concrete evaluation plan to (1) ensure every factual claim has an exact live-source citation with version, (2) detect cross-corpus hallucinations when sources conflict, (3) measure policy drift over time, and (4) deliver datasets, metrics, tooling, and a minimal eval script?</title>
