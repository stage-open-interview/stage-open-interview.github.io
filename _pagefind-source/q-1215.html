  <title>Design a beginner-friendly pipeline for a Slack-based support bot that lives in a single workspace. It should: (1) classify Slack messages into intents: &#039;password_reset&#039;, &#039;access_request&#039;, &#039;billing_issue&#039;, &#039;incident&#039;. (2) retrieve and present the most relevant FAQ article from a 100-article KB in English or Spanish. (3) operate with minimal latency on a shared CPU, and include a simple drift-detection plan and a rollout strategy with a safe fallback. Provide concrete components, data flow, and a short code snippet showing the classifier and retriever?</title>
