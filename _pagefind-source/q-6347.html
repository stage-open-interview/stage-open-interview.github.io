  <title>Context: Beginner AWS SysOps, a small web app deployed in one region with EC2 Auto Scaling behind an ALB and a PostgreSQL RDS. Design a beginner-friendly disaster recovery plan to recover in a second AWS region within 2 hours during a regional outage. Provide concrete steps using cross-region RDS backups or read replicas, cross-region S3 replication for logs, Route 53 failover with health checks, and an IaC template (CloudFormation or CDK) to redeploy quickly. Include a simple runbook, testing steps, and cost guardrails?</title>
