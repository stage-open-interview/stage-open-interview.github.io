  <title>In a high-throughput payments API, you have POST /payments with Idempotency-Key and a GET /payments/{id} to poll status. The downstream gateway is flaky, returning intermittent 500s; design a concrete end-to-end test plan to validate idempotency, exactly-once processing semantics, retry/backoff with jitter, and webhook reconciliation, under simulated outages and concurrent requests. Include specific test cases, data, and tooling suggestions?</title>
