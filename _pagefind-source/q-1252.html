  <title>You are training a large Transformer-based recommender model on multiple GPUs with a custom training loop in TensorFlow 2.x. The per-device batch is 256, but you want an effective global batch of 4096. Describe and implement how to use gradient accumulation to achieve this, including how to adjust the learning rate, BN handling, and mixed-precision considerations?</title>
