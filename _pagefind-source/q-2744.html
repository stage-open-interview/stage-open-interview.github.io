  <title>Design a multi-tenant data pipeline on GCP that ingests 50–100 GB/day of JSON events from Pub/Sub into BigQuery across two regions. Implement per-tenant isolation with dedicated datasets and topics, a robust data quality observability layer that validates schema conformance, nulls, duplicates, and timeliness, and real-time alerts. Include an automated remediation path (schema bumps and selective re-ingestion) and a clear rollback strategy using time travel. Provide architecture, data models, partitioning, testing, and rollback steps?</title>
