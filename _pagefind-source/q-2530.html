  <title>Design a production-ready calibration-and-drift pipeline for a binary classifier deployed in a high-stakes domain (e.g., loan approvals). The system must calibrate probabilities in real time as data drifts occur, detect distribution shift, trigger targeted retraining with limited labels, and provide explainability and auditing. Describe architecture, data flow, concrete metrics, and trade-offs?</title>
