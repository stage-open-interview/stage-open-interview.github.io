  <title>Design a latency-aware, privacy-preserving real-time anomaly-detection pipeline on GCP for a high-volume fintech telemetry stream. Ingest via Pub/Sub, Dataflow computes per-tenant rolling stats, raw payloads stored encrypted in Cloud Storage with per-tenant prefixes, aggregates in BigQuery with row-level ACLs, train weekly Vertex AI models and deploy a private online endpoint with per-tenant routing and VPC Service Controls, and implement drift and fairness alarms plus per-tenant rollback and audit logging for compliance. Include concrete schemas and failure handling across regional outages?</title>
