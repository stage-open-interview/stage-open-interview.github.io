  <title>Design an Azure DevOps pipeline for a multi-region SaaS web app that promotes a feature-flag release from dev to prod. The pipeline must (1) fetch per-env secrets from Azure Key Vault, (2) apply infrastructure changes with Terraform targeting two Azure regions, (3) gate promotions with policy approvals, (4) implement blue/green or canary traffic shifts via Azure Front Door for PROD, with 10/90 or similar, (5) perform post-deploy drift validation using Terraform state and Log Analytics, and (6) auto-rollback to the previous Terraform state and pause traffic on failure, while auditing all steps to Log Analytics. Provide the pipeline steps, artifacts, and rollback plan?</title>
