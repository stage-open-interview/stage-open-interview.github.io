  <title>Design a beginner-friendly GCP ML pipeline to train a ticket classifier that uses Vertex AI Feature Store for real-time features. Explain how to align training with feature store timestamps to prevent leakage, set up a simple offline-online consistency check, and describe how you would validate features before training. Include minimal pseudocode for a FeatureStore read during serving?</title>
