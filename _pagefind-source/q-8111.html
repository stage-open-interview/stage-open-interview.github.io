  <title>Design a streaming feature store for ML workloads with 3 sources feeding ~200 features at varying update rates. Requirements: per-record contracts, tenant isolation, feature versioning with time travel, schema evolution, and idempotent upserts into Iceberg. How would you implement ingestion, upsert semantics, drift tests, and monitoring? Include a concrete MERGE-based upsert pattern?</title>
