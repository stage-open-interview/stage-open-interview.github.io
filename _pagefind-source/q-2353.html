  <title>A Linux host runs three LXC containers. During peak hours, one container&#039;s API latency spikes while others stay responsive. Using only default tooling, describe a concrete, beginner-friendly diagnostic workflow to (1) determine if bottleneck is CPU, memory, or I/O at host or container level, (2) identify the container and the exact process responsible for the spike, and (3) propose a safe mitigation (e.g., adjust container limits, throttle I/O, or relocate service) with observability. Include exact commands and expected outputs?</title>
