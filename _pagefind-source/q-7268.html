  <title>Design a monocular edge CV pipeline that, from a single RGB camera mounted on a robotic gripper, detects and localizes deformable packaging (e.g., plastic pouches) on a cluttered shelf, and estimates their 6-DoF pose including occlusion-aware segmentation. New packaging designs arrive monthly; support 5-shot on-device adaptation with under 60 ms per frame. Describe architecture, data strategy (synthetic+real with domain randomization), losses, adaptation workflow, and evaluation metrics?</title>
