  <title>Scenario: A weighted directed graph with nonnegative weights tracks network latencies. Edges can be inserted or have their weights decreased in online batches of size B. After each batch, you must maintain exact distances from a fixed source S to all nodes. Propose a practical hybrid scheme that combines (i) an incremental update pass limited to affected nodes, (ii) periodic full re-computation every T batches, and (iii) a lazy rebuild trigger when incremental cost exceeds a threshold. Provide initial preprocessing, amortized update time per batch, memory bounds, two optimizations, and a comparison to re-running Dijkstra from scratch after every batch?</title>
