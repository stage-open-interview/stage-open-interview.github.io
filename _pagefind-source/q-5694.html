  <title>Design a KCA workflow for a real-time ad-tech platform deploying edge compute near bid servers in three regions. Each region uses a TPM-backed root, attests to a regional bootstrap, and enrolls a CSR to a central KCA issuing short-lived mTLS certificates (TTL 420s) bound to per-campaign SPIFFE IDs and a &#039;bidder&#039; scope. Include crypto agility, cross-region trust anchors, revocation, auditing, and a test plan focused on sub-50ms handshake latency under bursty bid traffic?</title>
