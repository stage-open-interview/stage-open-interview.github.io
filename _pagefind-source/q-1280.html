  <title>Scenario: A serverless workflow (API gateway -&gt; orchestrator -&gt; worker) serves thousands of tenants. Design a CKNE-aware tracing approach where every hop propagates a CKNE health signal in trace metadata and implement a per-tenant adaptive sampling policy that starts at 3% and scales to 25% during degradation. Include payload schemas, per-tenant health aggregation at the orchestrator, strategies to preserve trace fidelity during micro-bursts, and a minute-by-minute loop mapping health to sampling for the next window; provide a minimal payload example and a test plan?</title>
