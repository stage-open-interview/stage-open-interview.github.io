  <title>Scenario: In a fleet of autonomous vehicles operating across multiple regions, a recently rolled OTA firmware update causes sporadic misdetections in sensor fusion, leading to unsafe behavior in Region A and Region B. Design a CAPA program to detect, contain, and prevent recurrence. Include: 1) a CAPA data model capturing evidence, telemetry, firmware/OTA versions, and logs; 2) a region-aware lifecycle state machine for CAPA progression; 3) a minimal REST API to create/update CAPAs with linked logs/traces; 4) region- and sensor-type metrics to prove containment (recurrence rate, MTTR, false positives, drift); 5) an RCA template and a staged canary rollout plan for firmware/feature changes?</title>
