  <title>Design a robust multi-region release strategy in Azure DevOps for a real-time collaboration service deployed to AKS. The pipeline must support per-region canary rollouts using Istio, region-scoped feature flags in Azure App Configuration, per-region secrets in Azure Key Vault, auto-rollback on SLA deviations, and cost controls via HPA and budget alerts. Describe the YAML structure, gating approvals, health checks, telemetry correlation across regions, and rollback triggers. What files and steps would you implement?</title>
