  <title>You operate a private ML inference API hosted in a central AWS account. To serve customers in multiple AWS accounts across regions while avoiding Internet, design a cross-region PrivateLink solution with per-tenant onboarding/offboarding and 60-second revocation. Explain how to publish an endpoint service in each region, create per-tenant interface endpoints, implement Private DNS with Route 53, and constrain access with IAM trust policies and permission boundaries. Include onboarding/testing and cross-region failover steps?</title>
