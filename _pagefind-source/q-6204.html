  <title>Intermediate: In a real-time event processor, N producers emit events into a bounded global queue of size Q. A pool of M workers consumes events. Each event has a key (e.g., user_id). Guarantee per-key in-order processing across all producers while allowing parallel processing for different keys. Implement per-key FIFO buffers with a maximum size K and a global backpressure mechanism when the queue is full. Decide overflow policy (drop oldest, drop new, or reject) and justify?</title>
