  <title>Scenario: You manage a Terraform repo provisioning a data lake via a module named lake that uses for_each over environments and cloud_providers (aws, gcp). In prod, a resource within the prod gcp submodule storage_bucket prod_bucket was modified outside Terraform, causing drift only in prod. Describe exact steps to detect drift with terraform plan -detailed-exitcode, import the drifted resource into the correct module path, and perform a targeted apply to bring prod in line, including the exact module and resource addresses to target for both providers?</title>
