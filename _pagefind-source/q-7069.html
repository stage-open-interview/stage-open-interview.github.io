  <title>Design and implement an offline-first iOS module called RelayFeed that streams a live GraphQL feed, caches items in SQLite via GRDB, and uses Swift Concurrency (actors) to serialize access. It must support optimistic edits with per-item versioning conflict resolution and run background refresh via BGAppRefreshTask with battery-aware throttling. Include data models, persistence schema, and a concrete test plan. Provide a minimal Swift code sketch showing the Actor-based cache and a paginated GraphQL fetch. How would you approach this?</title>
