  <title>3-mic wearable office demo: design a beginner ICA pipeline to separate two voices captured by near-field mics in a noisy room. Outline: (i) whiten the 3 channels, (ii) apply a simple real-valued FastICA on short FFT frames to recover two sources, (iii) align permutation across frames via spatial-map correlation, (iv) include a lightweight online update to the demixing matrix for motion, (v) evaluate with synthetic ground truth (SDR/SIR) and a listening check; target &lt;100 ms latency on a low-power CPU?</title>
