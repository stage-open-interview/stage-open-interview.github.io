  <title>Design a fixed-point online convolutive ICA pipeline for a 12-mic live meeting room, constrained to embedded DSP. Use STFT-based whitening with fixed precision, a 12x12 demixer updated every 8 ms, and evaluate per-bin ICA vs joint diagonalization under quantization. Include drift tracking for nonstationary mixing and occasional mic dropouts, with a 200 ms end-to-end latency target and SDR/SIR ground-truth evaluation plan?</title>
