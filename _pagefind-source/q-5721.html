  <title>You&#039;re building a cross-platform React Native app for field technicians that must stay in sync with a central server via a persistent WebSocket. Design and implement a native module &#039;WebSocketSync&#039; (iOS and Android) that keeps a durable connection, queues outgoing messages while offline, reconnects with exponential backoff, and guarantees at-least-once delivery with idempotent event handlers. Provide an API surface (connect(url), subscribe(event, cb), publish(event, data)), a TS hook useWebSocketSync(channel) that replays missed messages after reconnect, and a minimal UI snippet to publish a &#039;checkpoint&#039; event. Discuss memory, battery, and consistency trade-offs?</title>
