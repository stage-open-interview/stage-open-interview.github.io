  <title>Advanced Snowflake-core scenario: A two-region data lake ingests RAW.TRANSACTIONS (id STRING, amount NUMBER, ts TIMESTAMP_NTZ, customer_id STRING) at high volume. You need near-real-time per-customer aggregates in CURATED.CUSTOMER_AGG, enforce role-based masking, and a disaster-recovery plan with &lt;5 min RPO across regions. Propose architecture using Streams, Tasks, MV/Materialized views, clustering, masking policies, and cross-region replication. Include exact SQL for: creating the stream on RAW.TRANSACTIONS, a TASK to upsert per-customer totals into CURATED.CUSTOMER_AGG, and a MV to support fast queries. Also discuss validation and rollback?</title>
