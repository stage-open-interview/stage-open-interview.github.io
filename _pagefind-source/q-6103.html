  <title>On a Linux host running mixed workloads (real-time audio path on NUMA node0 and analytics on node1), tail latency spikes occur due to cross-NUMA memory access and interconnect contention. Design a production plan to enforce strict NUMA locality and interconnect fairness: hardware topology checks, BIOS NUMA settings, kernel boot params (isolcpus, nohz_full), IRQ affinity, CPU/memory binding, cgroups v2 usage for CPU/membind, and a test plan with cyclictest and synthetic multi-channel load. What exact steps would you take and how would you verify?</title>
