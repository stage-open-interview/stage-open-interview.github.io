  <title>Scenario: A SaaS API platform must serve multiple tenants with strict data isolation. External clients hit a public API endpoint, but tenant data must be isolated at the data layer. Propose an Azure architecture using API Management, Front Door, Private Link, Key Vault, and Managed Identities to enforce per-tenant quotas, auditability, and compliance. Include authentication/authorization strategy, deployment blueprint, and trade-offs between per-tenant VNet isolation vs shared networking. How would you test security and DR?</title>
