  <title>You’re deploying a TensorFlow 2.x time-series anomaly detector that accepts variable-length sequences (up to 2048 timesteps) from edge sensors. Real-time latency target: 15 ms average, with spikes up to 1000 rps. Describe a serving design that uses tf.data preprocessing to bucket by sequence length (min padding), caching, and prefetch; handling RaggedTensor vs padded tensors; and a minimal tf.data snippet for sequences with 16 features. Include how you would measure latency and tune batch sizing and thread pools?</title>
