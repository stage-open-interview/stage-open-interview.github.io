  <title>On a RHEL 9 server hosting a critical web service, implement zero-downtime deployment with a versioned app directory and a symlink swap. Deploy to /opt/myapp/releases/vX, run a five-minute canary health check at http://localhost:8080/health, then swap /opt/myapp/current and reload the service; rollback by re-pointing current to the previous version and restarting. What exact steps and commands would you use to implement this deployment strategy?</title>
