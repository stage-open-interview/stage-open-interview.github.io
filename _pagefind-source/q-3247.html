  <title>Given a directed graph where each node i has a threshold t_i (0 ≤ t_i ≤ indeg(i)) and a node is true iff at least t_i of its in-neighbors are true, does there exist a fixed point S containing a specified T? If yes, compute the least such fixed point. Outline a linear-time propagation algorithm that handles cycles and illustrate with a concrete 6-node, 7-edge example?</title>
