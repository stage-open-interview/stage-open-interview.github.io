  <title>Scenario: a 64-mic array in a busy open-plan office captures live speech from multiple moving speakers with time-varying reverberation. Design a practical online convolutive ICA pipeline that (a) uses frequency-domain whitening and an online demixer, (b) handles nonstationary mixing with continuous updates, (c) decides between per-bin ICA vs joint diagonalization with cross-band permutation tracking, (d) supports sub-20 ms frame updates, and (e) includes a robust evaluation plan with ground-truth sources and SDR/SIR metrics?</title>
