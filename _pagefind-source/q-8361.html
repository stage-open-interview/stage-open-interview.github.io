  <title>You&#039;re operating a real-time image moderation service on AWS. Clients upload images to S3 (≤5 MB). Design an event-driven pipeline that routes each image to a multi-tenant SageMaker endpoint for safety scoring, uses SageMaker Clarify for explainability, stores results in S3, and upserts a compact audit log in DynamoDB with tenantId, imageKey, modelVersion, score, and explainability. Include IAM, encryption at rest, per-tenant isolation, error handling, and latency/cost targets?</title>
