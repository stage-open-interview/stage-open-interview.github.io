  <title>Design a privacy-preserving, edge-based ICA pipeline to separate overlapping speech captured by a distributed 32‑mic array where raw audio never leaves devices and only anonymized components are aggregated. Describe per‑device whitening with partial channels, online demixing updates, secure aggregation methods, permutation/scale alignment across devices, latency targets, drift handling, and an evaluation plan with synthetic ground truth and transcripts?</title>
