  <title>You are given an undirected simple graph G=(V,E) with n=|V| and m=|E|. Edges arrive online in batches of size B (B ≤ m) with no deletions. After each batch, output the current number of triangles in G. Propose a practical incremental triangle-counting structure that (i) preprocesses efficiently, (ii) updates amortized per batch, (iii) returns the triangle count in O(1) after each batch, (iv) uses near-linear space, (v) includes two optimizations, and (vi) shows how it compares to recomputing triangles from scratch after every batch. Provide asymptotics in terms of n,m,B?</title>
