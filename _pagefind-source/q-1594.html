  <title>You&#039;re building a real-time, multi-tenant feature-flag platform on Azure to serve traffic across three regions with sub-50ms evaluation latency. Each tenant has per-flag rules, canary/A/B experiments, and strict audit requirements. Outline end-to-end design: data model for flags and experiments, evaluation path, storage choices (Cosmos DB vs SQL), caching, event sourcing, cross-region synchronization, security (Managed Identities, Key Vault, RBAC), rollback strategy, and failure modes. Include how you&#039;d test canary safety and ensure tenant isolation?</title>
