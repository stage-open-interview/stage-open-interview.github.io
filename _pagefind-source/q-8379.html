  <title>Design a KCA workflow for a satellite-enabled IoT rail-sensing network with intermittent connectivity. Each sensor boots with a hardware root, attests to a regional bootstrap service, and enrolls a CSR to a central KCA issuing a short-lived TLS certificate (TTL 120s) bound to a per-device SPIFFE ID and an &#039;iot-sat&#039; scope. Include cross-region trust anchors, crypto agility with PQC fallback, revocation, auditing, and a test plan for backhaul restoration latency and clock skew handling?</title>
