  <title>You&#039;re building a regulated, multi-tenant analytics platform on Azure that ingests IoT and application logs from customers across three continents. Customers demand regional data residency while analytics must be global for cross-tenant benchmarks. Propose a practical, cost-conscious architecture that enforces per-tenant data isolation (at rest and in transit), regional ingestion, geo-redundant storage, cross-region analytics, and auditable access control using Azure native services. Include data plane vs control plane separation, and show how you&#039;d satisfy RPO/RTO targets and regulatory requirements?</title>
