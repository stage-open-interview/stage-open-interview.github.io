  <title>In a shared ML model registry used by multiple teams at Meta and Nvidia, design a complete plan to enforce that every model artifact (weights, config, tokenizer) is attested with provenance including dataset version, training code hash, and environment, using Sigstore cosign, Rekor, and a Kyverno/OPA policy to gate pushes and deployments to inference clusters. Provide signing commands, attestation storage layout, a policy snippet, and an end-to-end validation plan with a compliant and a noncompliant push?</title>
