  <title>Design a fault-tolerant, bounded telemetry router: partition by region, with per-device FIFO buffers feeding a small worker pool. Use a central bounded queue to backpressure producers; ensure in-order processing per device via sequence counters and per-device reorder buffers. On regional outage, spill to durable regional store and throttle producers with backpressure. Auto-scale workers from 1 to K based on queue depth and latency?</title>
