  <title>Scenario: A Terraform repo migrates a per-env database deployment from count to for_each over environments. In prod, a single aws_db_instance drifted after the refactor. Describe exact steps to detect drift with terraform plan -detailed-exitcode, then reconcile prod by migrating the drifted address from the old count-based address to the new for_each address and applying a targeted change, followed by a full plan. Include the exact resource address to target: module.db[&quot;prod&quot;].aws_db_instance[&quot;db-prod&quot;]?</title>
