  <title>Design a pipeline that serves as both a data warehouse and an ML feature store. Ingest batch and streaming signals from 60 partners, partition data by region, and store both raw data and computed features in Iceberg. Implement a versioned feature registry, backfill-friendly feature definitions, and drift alerts to detect distribution shifts. Describe parity between batch and streaming features, and provide a concrete feature example: user_average_purchase_by_region. How would you test and monitor this system?</title>
