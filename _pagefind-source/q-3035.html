  <title>Across three AWS accounts (dev, staging, prod), a shared VPC module creates per-account security groups with for_each over accounts and a nested for_each over rules. In prod, an inbound rule for 203.0.113.0/24 on TCP 22 was removed via manual change. Describe exact steps to detect the drift and fix only prod binding using Terraform CLI with init/plan/apply and a -target run, then re-run a full plan to confirm no drift. Include the exact resource address to target?</title>
