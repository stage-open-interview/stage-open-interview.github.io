  <title>In a three-region real-time messaging service using QUIC with TLS, users report sporadic tail latency spikes on new connections during peak hours. No app changes allowed. Provide a concrete diagnostic plan to distinguish (a) QUIC handshake stalls and 0-RTT acceptance, (b) TLS handshake negotiation on edge proxies, and (c) per-edge queueing or NAT translation, with exact commands and data to collect, and propose a robust mitigation that preserves ECMP?</title>
