  <title>You are starting a beginner-friendly Azure data engineer task: daily telemetry logs arrive in ADLS Gen2 under /raw/telemetry/ in mixed formats (CSV and nested JSON). Design an event-driven pipeline using Azure Data Factory that fires on blob creation, ingests files, flattens nested structures to a canonical schema, handles optional fields and few schema drift cases, and loads into a simple star schema in Azure Synapse Analytics. Include incremental loading with a watermark and basic data quality checks. What components and steps would you implement?</title>
