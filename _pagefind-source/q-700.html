  <title>You&#039;re building a real-time analytics dashboard that shows the top-k most frequent event types from a high-volume log stream (e.g., clicks, errors). Each event has a string type. Design a data structure and algorithm to maintain the current top-k frequencies with online increments, aiming for roughly O(log k) update time and O(n) memory. Explain how you handle ties and memory growth, and compare with a naive approach that re-sorts after every insert?</title>
