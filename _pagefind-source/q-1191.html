  <title>Scenario: A data platform CI/CD pipeline deploys to Data Lake Gen2, Synapse, and a storage account across three subscriptions using a non-interactive service principal. Design a secure, rotating, auditable auth model: App Registration with certificate-based OAuth, Key Vault-stored certs rotated every 30 days, per-resource RBAC with least privilege, automatic revocation on build failure, and validation steps. Include how you would test access during runs and how to roll back changes if needed?</title>
