  <title>On GCP, design a cross-tenant streaming analytics pipeline for 4 TB/day of JSON events ingested via Pub/Sub with strict per-tenant isolation and CMEK-based encryption. Ingest raw data to Cloud Storage as Parquet, transform in Dataflow into per-tenant BigQuery datasets with per-tenant masking via Cloud DLP, and publish aggregates to a partner via BigQuery Data Exchange. Enforce per-tenant data contracts in Data Catalog with end-to-end lineage, and enable 24h per-tenant rollback by replaying Pub/Sub from a retention topic. Include cross-region failover, schema evolution, and cost controls?</title>
