  <title>You&#039;re deploying an edge-first cca_score pipeline: a 2-feature model runs on-device with on-device differential privacy and signed model manifests. Describe the end-to-end data flow, data retention, and how the device fetches a signed manifest, computes the score, and posts an attestation back for verification. Include endpoints, data formats, and a testing plan for offline and tamper-resistance scenarios?</title>
