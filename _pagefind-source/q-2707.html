  <title>You&#039;re setting up Vault in a multi-tenant environment. Beginner task: enable a file audit device to log all requests to /var/log/vault_audit.log in JSON format, set up OS logrotate to safely rotate the audit log without losing data, and demonstrate how to verify in the audit log that a tenant&#039;s read of their own secret is recorded without exposing secret contents. Include exact Vault commands for enabling the audit, a sample logrotate config snippet, and a sample CLI session that would generate an audit entry?</title>
