  <title>Design a globally distributed event store for a chat app where user_id determines the shard via consistent hashing. Each shard has 3 replicas in distinct regions; ingestion writes go to a leader replica and durably commit to all replicas using a 2-of-3 quorum. Reads are served from any replica with read-your-writes guarantees. Explain shard rebalancing without downtime, hot shard mitigation, cross-region replication lag, and failure recovery strategies?</title>
