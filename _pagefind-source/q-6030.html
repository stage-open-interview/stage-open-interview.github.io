  <title>You&#039;re building a SaaS ML platform that hosts customer-specific models on a single SageMaker Multi-Model Endpoint. Data for each tenant resides in separate S3 buckets in the same region, and data must never mix or leak between tenants. Propose: (1) per-tenant routing and on-demand vs pre-loaded model loading; (2) isolation and IAM/KMS controls; (3) scaling and cost during bursty traffic; (4) a validation plan with tenant-level auditing and drift checks; (5) test plan for end-to-end data isolation?</title>
