  <title>Design a KCA workflow for an edge AI inference fleet of Nvidia edge devices (ARM+TPM2.0) that boot with a hardware-backed key and obtain a short-lived client certificate from a central CA after device attestation. Include per-device policy enforcement for GPU memory isolation, health attestations to a device health service, TTL 900s, auto-renew on reconnect, revocation via OCSP/CRLs, offline root fallback, auditing, and a minimal test plan?</title>
