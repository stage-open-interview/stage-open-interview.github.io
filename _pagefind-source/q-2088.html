  <title>You manage access flags as a directed graph with A ≤ B meaning &#039;A true implies B true&#039;. Given a required set T of flags that must be true, decide if a consistent assignment exists and produce the least-true model containing T. Describe a linear-time forward-closure algorithm that propagates truth along edges until a fixpoint, and how it handles cycles. Include a concrete 6-flag example with 7 relations?</title>
