  <title>Your organization runs three teams (Payments, Logistics, Catalog) sharing a shared event bus used for order processing. A critical, high-velocity feature requires emitting two new event types; the bus must support exactly-once delivery and robust retry but current replay bugs threaten idempotency. You have 9 weeks to ship the feature, with a 2-week safety buffer. Propose a concrete cross-team plan: ownership for telemetry, schema evolution, retries and idempotency; capacity split (60/25/15); milestones; go/no-go criteria; and the rituals you would adjust to ensure on-time delivery and reliability?</title>
