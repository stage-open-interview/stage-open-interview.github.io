  <title>Design a bounded, fair, multi-producer/multi-consumer system for real-time order matching in a crypto exchange. Many producers submit limit orders; multiple workers attempt matches against an in-memory order book. Guarantee bounded memory, backpressure, and starvation-free fairness across producers (e.g., per-producer quotas or weighted fairness). Describe data structures, synchronization, and a minimal runnable Java snippet showing enqueue and a worker loop?</title>
