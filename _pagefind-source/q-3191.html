  <title>You&#039;re building a real-time, event-driven AWS pipeline to ingest live webinar audio streams that arrive as 30-second chunks uploaded to S3. Design an end-to-end flow that uses Amazon Transcribe for streaming transcription with speaker diarization, Amazon Comprehend to compute per-speaker sentiment and key entities, and stores transcripts, per-speaker metrics, and a compact index in DynamoDB. Include privacy controls (PII redaction), data retention, IAM roles, error handling, idempotency, and cost considerations?</title>
