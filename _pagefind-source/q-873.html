  <title>A CNPA service receives events over HTTP, writes to PostgreSQL, and publishes to Kafka. During peak hours, read latency spikes. Describe a concrete debugging plan to determine whether the bottleneck is the HTTP handler, the DB query, or the Kafka producer, including exact steps, metrics to collect, and concrete changes (indexes, pooling, prepared statements, idempotent producer) and how you would verify impact?</title>
