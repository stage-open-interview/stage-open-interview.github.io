  <title>You&#039;re building a text formatter. Given a list of word lengths L = [l1, l2, ..., ln] and a maximum line width W, wrap the words into lines so that all lines except the last incur a penalty of (W - usedWidth)^2, where usedWidth = sum of word lengths on the line plus spaces between words. The last line has 0 penalty. Propose a dynamic programming solution with dp[i] representing the minimum penalty for words i..n-1, specify the recurrence, reconstruction method, and time/space complexity. How would you implement it?</title>
