  <title>You&#039;re deploying real-time anomaly detection on telemetry from 50k edge cameras across campuses. Labels are scarce, data drifts with time, and bandwidth to central is limited. Propose a practical architecture and training plan that balances latency, privacy, and accuracy: choose models, training regime (self-supervised + federated updates), deployment (edge vs cloud), monitoring, and evaluation metrics. Be concrete about components and data flow?</title>
