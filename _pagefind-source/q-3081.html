  <title>In a small team, a service needs dynamic PostgreSQL credentials from Vault. Design and implement a minimal AppRole workflow: policy allowing access to database/creds/role-a only; a database secret engine role role-a with 30m TTL; an AppRole service-a bound to that policy; a runnable script that authenticates with AppRole and prints the generated connection string. Include exact Vault commands and a runnable example script?</title>
