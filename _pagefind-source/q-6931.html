  <title>Design a real-time monocular 3D scene understanding module for a drone that must detect, segment, and estimate 3D pose for dynamic obstacles (e.g., birds, suspended loads, other drones) while flying through urban canyons at 15 m/s using a single RGB camera. The system must support 3-shot adaptation to novel obstacle types with under 20 ms per frame on an edge device. Describe architecture, temporal fusion, losses, adaptation workflow, and evaluation metrics?</title>
