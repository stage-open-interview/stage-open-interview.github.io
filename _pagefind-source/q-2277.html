  <title>In Snowflake, ingest telemetry into RAW.events (device_id STRING, ts TIMESTAMP_NTZ, payload VARIANT) from two sources: real-time stream and nightly batch. You must deliver per-device 15-minute latency metrics for the last hour (avg_reading, cnt). Propose an end-to-end architecture using a Stream, a Materialized View (MV) or incremental aggregation, and a TASK scheduled every 15 minutes to refresh. Include exact SQL to create the stream, MV, task, and a validation query to prove latency targets?</title>
