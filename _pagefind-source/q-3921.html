  <title>Design an iOS data pipeline for a live analytics feed. The app connects to a WebSocket to receive events (JSON per event), decodes them into a Codable Event, and renders a live, diffable list. Requirements: (1) use URLSessionWebSocketTask for the socket, (2) an in-memory buffer capped at 1,000 events with oldest drops, (3) on-disk queue preserving order with atomic writes, (4) a deterministic replay API for offline mode, (5) UI stays responsive; discuss concurrency, error handling, backpressure, and testing?</title>
