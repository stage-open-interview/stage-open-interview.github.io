  <title>You’re performance testing a real-time analytics platform that ingests 50k events/sec with 15% external enrichment calls. Design a practical plan to ensure end-to-end latency stays under 200 ms at 2x peak, including topology, load patterns, and metrics. Explain how you would instrument tracing, simulate backpressure, and validate autoscaling, circuit breakers, and SLA adherence?</title>
