  <title>In a globally distributed service using HTTP/3 over QUIC and TLS at edge, mobile clients roaming between networks experience intermittent QUIC connection resets and p95 latency spikes during peak hours. No app changes. Outline a concrete diagnostic plan to distinguish issues caused by QUIC connection migration, edge-cache revalidation, and DNS path changes, and propose practical mitigations that preserve ECMP and TLS posture?</title>
