  <title>Design a per-tenant weekly retention pipeline in Snowflake using dbt where raw events live in staging.events with tenant_id, user_id, first_seen_at, occurred_at, and an events.users table. Create analytics.tenant_retention (tenant_id, cohort_week, retention_users, total_users) that computes weekly retention by cohort (first_seen_week) with incremental loading, and late data handling up to 4 days. Also implement analytics.global_retention that aggregates per-tenant retention across tenants with tenant_dim country/plan, ensuring cross-tenant lineage and isolation. Include schema-drift guards, tests (not_null, unique), and a snapshot of analytics.tenants to track cohort definitions. Explain how you ensure isolation and lineage?</title>
