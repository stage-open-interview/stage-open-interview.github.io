  <title>Design a practical test plan for a payments API with POST /payments/process that uses an idempotency-key to guard against duplicates across ledger, order, and an event bus. Outline concrete test cases for high-concurrency identical keys, verify a single ledger write and a single order update, and validate eventual ledger consistency via polling. Include backoff/retry validation and simulate ledger outages or event-bus delays?</title>
