  <title>Implement a local-first photo uploader in an iOS app: when users select multiple photos for upload, queue them in a disk-backed manifest, process with a bounded concurrency worker, upload via URLSession background tasks, retry with exponential backoff on failures, and expose progress to the UI. How would you implement and test this to ensure persistence across relaunch and background/foreground transitions?</title>
