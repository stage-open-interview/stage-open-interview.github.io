  <title>Design a runtime-extensible transport layer for a data ingestion service that can route data to HTTP, Kafka, or gRPC transports. New transports should be pluggable at runtime without changing core; design a minimal interface and a registry to support this. Which design pattern would you choose and how would you implement it?
