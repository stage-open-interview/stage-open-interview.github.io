  <title>Design a runtime-pluggable, per-route transformer and throttling policy system for a real-time event router. Each route maps an event type to a transformer and a rate-limit policy; new transformers (enrich, redact, normalize) and new policies (token-bucket, fixed-window, leaky-bucket) must be addable at runtime without touching the router core. Which pattern would you adopt and how would you structure the minimal interfaces and registry?</title>
