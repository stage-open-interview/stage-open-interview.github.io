  <title>Design an end-to-end test for a real-time collaborative document editor (like Google Docs) integrated into a messaging app. The editor uses CRDTs over WebSockets to sync edits among N clients. Outline how you would implement an E2E test that isolates documents, simulates latency and network partitions, handles offline edits, and validates CRDT convergence after reconnect. Include tooling choices and steps?</title>
