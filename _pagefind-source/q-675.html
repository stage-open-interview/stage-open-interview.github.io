  <title>You manage a two-region AWS deployment (us-east-1, us-west-2) behind an ALB with private subnets, NAT gateway, and RDS in us-east-1. During business hours, us-west-2 exhibits spike in 5xx errors and higher latency. Outline immediate incident triage steps, AWS CLI commands to run, how you’d identify root causes (NAT saturation, DNS routing, cross-region replication lag), and both short- and long-term mitigations with verification steps?</title>
