  <title>Scenario: A 12-antenna RF receiver in a mobile urban environment captures overlapping transmissions with time-varying channels and Doppler. Design a real-time convolutional ICA pipeline to separate sources. Include: (i) block-based processing, (ii) whitening, (iii) online demixing with a 12×12 matrix, (iv) choice between per-bin ICA vs joint diagonalization, (v) cross-frame permutation alignment, (vi) Doppler/adaptation handling, (vii) latency target, (viii) evaluation plan with ground-truth waveforms or synthetic signals and SDR/SIR. Provide key trade-offs and early implementation steps?</title>
