  <title>In a matrix organization with six squads: API, Web, Mobile, Data, Platform, and SRE, across two regions, a regulatory change requires data locality and strict privacy controls for a new analytics feature. The project must go live in 12 weeks with minimal latency impact and improved MTTR. Propose a concrete plan: define SLOs/SLIs for privacy, performance, and reliability; implement dual-track planning (feature vs compliance); allocate capacity (e.g., 50/25/25 split); assign cross-cutting owners; outline a 12-week rollout with milestones and go/no-go criteria; include telemetry changes, incident response, and risk mitigation?</title>
