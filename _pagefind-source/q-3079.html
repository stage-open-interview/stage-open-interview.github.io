  <title>Design a cross-process, lock-free bounded queue in shared memory for two processes on a NUMA system, with 1&lt;&lt;18 slots of 128 bytes. Use per-slot 64-bit sequence numbers and head/tail indices. Producers spin until slot.seq==tail, write payload, and publish slot.seq=tail+1 with a release; consumers read with acquire, validate, and advance head. Reclaim via epoch-based scheme across both processes. Microbenchmark: vary producers/consumers, report p95/p99 latency and sustained throughput; check data integrity under contention?</title>
