  <title>Scenario: A partner telemetry dataset arrives as tarballs with JSON lines into a shared Cloud Storage bucket after signing. Build an end-to-end GCP ingestion pipeline that (1) triggers on finalization, (2) streams data through Pub/Sub per environment, (3) runs a Dataflow streaming job that validates schema, masks PII with Cloud DLP, and writes per-tenant data into partitioned BigQuery tables, (4) enforces per-environment isolation and end-to-end correlation_id in Cloud Logging, (5) guarantees idempotent processing with per-file checksums and a load manifest, and (6) includes testing and rollback strategies?</title>
