  <title>In a two-region deployment with a single writer in us-east-1 and analytic reads in eu-west-1, design a CDC pipeline to keep a near real-time analytic store updated within 5 seconds of commits, while masking per-tenant data and enforcing encryption at rest and in transit. Compare AWS DMS, Debezium/Kafka, and native Aurora logical replication, and provide concrete configuration (engine, instance types, replica counts, PITR, KMS keys, VPC endpoints, and network topology) to meet RPO 5s and RTO 60s?</title>
