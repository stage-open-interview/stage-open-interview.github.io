  <title>In a 32-channel videoconferencing room, design an online, causally updatable convolutive ICA pipeline to separate moving talkers under nonstationary noise. Propose a two-stage whitening (offline neural whitening followed by online adaptive whitening) and compare per-bin ICA vs joint diagonalization. Detail how you track cross-time permutation, handle rapid speaker shifts, latency targets, and how you would validate with ground-truth sources?</title>
