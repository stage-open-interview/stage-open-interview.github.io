  <title>Scenario: A Linux host running several VMs experiences intermittent memory pressure during business hours, causing guest pauses. Using only default tools, outline a beginner-friendly diagnostic workflow to (1) determine if host memory pressure or VM ballooning is the bottleneck, (2) identify which VM(s) are affected and estimate their memory footprint, and (3) apply a safe mitigation (e.g., cap VM memory via libvirt, adjust host swappiness) while preserving observability. Include exact commands and expected outputs?</title>
