  <title>Design a GCP ML pipeline for regionalized demand forecasting: ingest streaming events via Pub/Sub, preprocess with Dataflow, store raw and features in Cloud Storage and BigQuery, train regional Vertex AI models with per-region registries, and deploy with region-specific traffic routing. How would you implement per-region drift thresholds and a rollback plan to the last stable model, and tie lineage via Data Catalog?</title>
