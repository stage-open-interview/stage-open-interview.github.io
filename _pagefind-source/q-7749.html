  <title>Describe a tiny kernel-safe per-core credit-based IO-rate limiter: each tick, threads earn one credit; CPU work consumes 1 credit per tick; I/O operations consume 2 credits. If a thread&#039;s credits would go negative, it yields and blocks on a per-core wait queue until the next tick. Provide data structures, race-free update rules, and a small C-like sketch for grant_credit, spend_credit, and tick_handler. How would you test fairness under mixed CPU/I/O workloads?</title>
