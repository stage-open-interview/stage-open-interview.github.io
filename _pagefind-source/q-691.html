  <title>You&#039;re planning a delivery route along a straight street of n blocks. At block i you can advance up to jumps[i] blocks (at least 1). How many distinct routes reach block n-1 from block 0? If unreachable, return 0. Propose a dynamic-programming approach with dp[i] as ways to reach i and outline its time/space complexity, edge cases, and a brief correctness justification. How would you implement it?</title>
