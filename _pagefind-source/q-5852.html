  <title>In an online ad-analytics gateway used by Snap and Stripe, sessions stream with 60 numeric features each; distributions are highly skewed and many values missing. Design an incremental PCA pipeline that reduces to 8 components for real-time anomaly scoring. Explain online imputation, scaling, how to update components with drift, memory budget, and how to translate top loadings into actionable alerts under 50 ms latency for a live dashboard. Include evaluation plan with prequential holdouts?</title>
