  <title>You&#039;re building an Android module to support background, continuous BLE logging from an OBD-II dongle for a fleet-tracking app. Requirements: maintain a stable BLE connection with automatic reconnect and backoff; buffer data locally in Room during disconnect; periodically upload batched logs via WorkManager with exponential backoff; use a ForegroundService while in the background; respect Doze/App Standby; outline data flow, architecture, and a minimal skeleton of the BLE manager, DAO, and Worker; include a test plan for connectivity changes and battery constraints?</title>
