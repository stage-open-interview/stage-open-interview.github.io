  <title>Design a concurrent per-vehicle telemetry processor. N producers emit events with vehicle_id and timestamp into bounded per-vehicle buffers of size B. M workers consume from all buffers, preserving per-vehicle in-order delivery across producers. Support dynamic worker resizing, per-vehicle backpressure, and a lateness policy: drop events with timestamp older than T relative to processing time; otherwise enqueue. Provide data structures and a concrete test plan?</title>
