  <title>In a two-region deployment behind regional CDNs with TLS termination at the edge, EU users report intermittent HTTPS connection setup delays during peaks while data transfer after connect is fine. Outline a concrete diagnostic plan to distinguish whether DNS TTL/path issues, TLS handshake stalls, CDN edge cache misses, or regional routing is to blame, including exact commands and data to collect, and propose a mitigation that preserves existing load balancing without app changes?</title>
