  <title>You&#039;re building an AWS-only, event-driven video processing pipeline for user-uploaded webinars (MP4) up to 4 GB. On upload to S3, design a flow that uses Step Functions to orchestrate: (1) Amazon Transcribe with speaker diarization for a multi-speaker transcript in the original language, (2) Translate to English for captions, (3) generate SRT captions with accurate timestamps, (4) use Comprehend to extract topics per speaker, (5) store transcripts, captions, and topic summaries in S3, and upsert a DynamoDB index with videoId, originalTranscriptKey, captionsKey, translatedKey, topics, and duration. Include IAM, error handling, privacy, and cost considerations?</title>
