  <title>You&#039;re training a large language model for Notion&#039;s AI features. Your model is overfitting on the training data but underperforming on validation. Design a comprehensive regularization strategy that addresses both L1/L2 regularization and more advanced techniques like dropout and early stopping. How would you implement cross-validation to ensure your hyperparameters generalize across different user data distributions?</title>
