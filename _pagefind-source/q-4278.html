  <title>Design a real-time feature store on Azure for a globally distributed ride-hailing platform: ingest streaming vehicle telemetry from Azure IoT Hub into ADLS Gen2, compute offline features with Databricks Delta Lake, and serve online features from Cosmos DB. Ensure feature versioning, schema evolution, data quality checks, end-to-end lineage via Purview, and multi-region consistency with latency constraints. What would you implement and why?</title>
