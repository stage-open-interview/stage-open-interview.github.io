  <title>You&#039;re validating a real-time event-logging pipeline that streams JSON events at 1M/sec into Snowflake via Kafka Connect to Snowpipe in a multi-region setup (AWS+GCP). During an 8-hour test, traffic spikes to 3x with 10x bursts every 90 minutes. How would you design a performance test to measure ingestion latency, backpressure, autoscaling, data-loss risk, and downstream query SLAs, including tooling and rollback plan?</title>
