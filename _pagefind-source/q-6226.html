  <title>Scenario: An IoT fleet in multiple regions streams telemetry in CSV and JSON via Kinesis Firehose into S3 across several AWS accounts. Design an end-to-end ingestion path that lands data as Parquet with daily partitions, using AWS Glue for ETL and the data catalog, and Lake Formation for access controls. Address schema evolution with mixed formats, data quality checks, partition strategy and compaction, testing and rollback, and cost monitoring. Which design choices and trade-offs would you make?</title>
