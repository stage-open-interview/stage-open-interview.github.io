  <title>You&#039;re building a real-time analytics component for a fintech platform. You must maintain the number of distinct values in the most recent W events in a streaming fashion. Implement two operations: append(v) to push a new event value, and distinctCount() to return the number of unique values among the last W events. Assume values are integers up to 1e9 and W can be large. Provide a simple approach with its time/memory costs, then describe an amortized-constant-time solution using a hashmap plus a circular buffer, and discuss edge cases (e.g., large W, many duplicates). How would you implement and analyze it?</title>
