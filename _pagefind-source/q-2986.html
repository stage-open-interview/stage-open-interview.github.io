  <title>In a Vertex AI deployment with multiple environments (dev/staging/prod) and a shared data platform, ensure artifact provenance and integrity from training to production using Binary Authorization, CMEK, Artifact Registry, and CI/CD. Outline a concrete workflow: signing artifacts with CMEK keys, requiring attestations for deployment, gating deployments with policy checks, and testing rollback by revoking attestations and re-deploying the last-good artifact. How would you implement auditing and rollback tests?</title>
