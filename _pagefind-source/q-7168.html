  <title>Design an end-to-end NLP system for an in-car assistant that supports 60+ languages with real-time on-device ASR. The system must preserve privacy (no raw audio leaves the car), handle code-switching and ambient noise, perform intent recognition and slot filling, and execute safe vehicle actions. Propose a federated-learning plan to improve models across a fleet, with latency ~200 ms per utterance on embedded hardware, drift detection, and rollout/rollback strategy. What would be your architecture and testing approach?</title>
