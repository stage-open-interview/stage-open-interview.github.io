  <title>Design a practical retrieval-augmented search system for a large-scale code documentation portal used by Meta, Zoom, and Robinhood engineers. The system should chunk documents into 512-token blocks, generate embeddings with a robust model, store them in a vector DB with per-repo namespace and access controls, and support multi-tenant usage. Explain how you handle embedding drift, index freshness, latency constraints for real-time queries, and a robust fallback plan when a component fails. Include how you would evaluate recall and latency with real-world repo sizes and a concrete data flow from query to answer?</title>
