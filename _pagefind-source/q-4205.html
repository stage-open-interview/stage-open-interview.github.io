  <title>Context: A Citadel/Instacart-like multi-tenant e-commerce platform runs microservices in Kubernetes and a central data lake on AWS. A widely-used open-source library has a compromised release that propagates through transitive dependencies. Design an advanced, production-grade secure software supply chain plan to prevent compromised code from reaching production within 24 hours. Include SBOM generation, dependency pinning, reproducible builds, cryptographic signing, CI/CD verification, runtime attestation, per-tenant secret controls, gated approvals, and a 24-hour incident response/contingency playbook with measurable success criteria?</title>
