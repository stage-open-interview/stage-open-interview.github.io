  <title>You&#039;re operating a CNF-based API gateway deployed across three regions behind a service mesh. Propose a practical upgrade workflow that enforces runtime integrity along with image attestations: (a) sign images with Cosign using a KMS-backed key and publish SBOMs, (b) require TPM/measured-boot attestation plus runtime integrity checks for CNFs, (c) roll out region-by-region with per-tenant canaries and live connection migration, (d) implement drift detection and automatic rollback on attestation/runtime mismatch, (e) surface observability for sign-off, attestation, and rollback triggers.
