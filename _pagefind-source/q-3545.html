Each event includes user_id, event_ts, app_version, and a nested payload with optional fields that can evolve. Build an end-to-end flow with per-record data contracts, idempotent upserts, and per-record lineage; support late data, GDPR deletion, and maintain an online feature store for scoring with sub-100ms reads.
