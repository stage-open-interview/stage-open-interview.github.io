  <title>Scenario: An IoT fleet in AWS publishes telemetry to AWS IoT Core in Account A, which triggers a Lambda in Account B to write to DynamoDB in Account B and S3 in Account C. As a beginner, design a practical security pattern that enforces per-device isolation, least privilege, and immutable audit trails. Include per-tenant IoT policies, mutual TLS, certificate rotation, cross-account IAM roles and trusts for Lambda, CMK rotation for data at rest, and a test plan with breach simulations?</title>
