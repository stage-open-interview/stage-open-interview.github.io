  <title>You operate a multi-tenant data platform on AWS with three tenants, each in separate VPCs, services deployed to an EKS cluster in us-east-1. Implement a cross-account, tenant-scoped CI/CD using FluxCD to promote per-tenant Helm overlays from staging to prod, with Canary upgrades and 5xx rollback. Add a hot-standby DR in us-west-2 with RDS Postgres, Global Accelerator, and Route 53 failover. Include IAM SCPs, per-tenant roles, and minimal tenant values + FluxCD Kustomization examples. What would you build and how would you verify resilience and cost controls?</title>
