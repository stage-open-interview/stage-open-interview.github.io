  <title>You&#039;re given a list of n task durations L. Partition the tasks into consecutive days (each day at least one task); the cost of a day is the maximum duration on that day. Devise a DP to minimize the total cost across all days. Define dp[i] as the minimum cost for the first i tasks, provide the recurrence, reconstruction method, and complexity. How would you implement it?</title>
