  <title>In a production Swarm across two data centers with four nodes, implement end-to-end image provenance using Cosign. Sign CI artifacts, publish signatures to a registry, and enforce verification before deploys. Outline the exact steps: key management, signing workflow in CI, signature verification at pull-time, updating services with image digests, and a rollback plan if verification fails. Provide concrete Cosign commands and how to incorporate into a CI/CD pipeline?</title>
