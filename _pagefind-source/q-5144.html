  <title>You&#039;re building a poly-protocol API gateway that accepts REST, GraphQL, and gRPC and routes to a mixed backend (REST, GraphQL, and gRPC services). Propose a concrete plan to: (1) translate REST calls to GraphQL queries and gRPC invocations with minimal latency, (2) publish an OpenAPI spec that mirrors the backend capabilities as REST, including schemas and examples, (3) enforce multi-tenant JWT auth with per-tenant audiences and rotates JWKS, (4) implement idempotency via request-id dedupe cache, (5) bridge streaming (GraphQL subscriptions and gRPC streams) to REST clients, (6) outline failure modes, retries, and backoff. Include data structures and a small translation snippet?</title>
