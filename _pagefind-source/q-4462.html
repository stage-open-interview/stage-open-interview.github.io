  <title>You are performance testing a ride-hailing platform&#039;s dispatch service. During a city-wide event, requests surge 20x in several zones while drivers cluster unevenly. The system relies on geospatial routing and an external geocoding service with rate limits. How would you design a practical performance test to identify bottlenecks in matchmaking, routing, and external dependencies, ensuring fairness across zones and stable SLA for 95th latency?</title>
