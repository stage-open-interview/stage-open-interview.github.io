  <title>You&#039;re building a React Native app for field technicians that must collect GPS and sensor data in the background every 15 minutes, even when the app is suspended. Describe a cross‑platform architecture using Android WorkManager and iOS BGTaskScheduler, a minimal RN bridge, and a small code sketch of a BackgroundTaskManager that schedules tasks, persists deadlines, and handles results. Include edge cases like battery saver, app termination, and user-initiated cancel?</title>
