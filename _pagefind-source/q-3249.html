  <title>Design an Azure DevOps YAML pipeline to deploy a multi-region service on AKS with Istio traffic shifting. Each region uses its own namespace and AKS context; fetch region secrets from Azure Key Vault; apply per-tenant feature flags from Azure App Configuration; implement progressive rollout with approvals, health checks, and telemetry correlation in Application Insights; and auto-rollback on latency or error thresholds with cost controls.
