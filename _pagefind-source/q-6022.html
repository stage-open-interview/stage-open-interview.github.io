  <title>Beginner CNF certification: In a multi-tenant Kubernetes cluster hosting CNF gateways, design an end-to-end runtime attestation flow using software-based attestation (e.g., Keylime) to ensure only Cosign-signed images with SBOMs run in the data plane. Include steps to deploy per-node attestation agents, gate admissions with an attestation verdict, surface per-tenant visibility on deployments, and provide a minimal one-namespace validation manifest before rollout. What would you implement?</title>
