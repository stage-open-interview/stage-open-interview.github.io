  <title>You&#039;re building a real-time collaborative whiteboard for a chat/video platform at Discord/Airbnb/Netflix scale. Each of 5–10k rooms can have up to 200 concurrent editors and must stay highly available with &lt;100 ms latency. Explain your stack decisions: transport (WebSocket vs gRPC streaming), per-room state partitioning, operation encoding, and conflict resolution (CRDT vs OT). How would you handle exactly-once delivery and failure recovery?</title>
