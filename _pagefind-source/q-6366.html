  <title>Design a real-time event router for a chat platform that guarantees per-room FIFO processing while enabling parallelism across rooms. N producers enqueue messages into a bounded global ring buffer of size C. Implement a lock-free multi-producer/multi-consumer router using per-room local queues inside workers and a global scheduler to balance backpressure. On overflow, apply a room-aware eviction: remove the oldest message from the least recently active room to preserve freshness for active rooms while preserving per-room order. Provide concrete data structures and outline a practical test plan validating per-room ordering, backpressure behavior, and starvation avoidance?</title>
