  <title>Design a global Azure data lakehouse for real-time fraud analytics. Ingest streaming transaction events from on-prem ERP into ADLS Gen2, apply schema-drift tolerant transformations, and store as Delta Lake tables with governance via Unity Catalog. Implement incremental loads with CDC and watermark, ensure end-to-end lineage via Purview, and support multi-region reads with geo-replication. Which components and patterns would you choose, and how would you configure them to balance latency, cost, and compliance?</title>
