  <title>You’re building a high-throughput streaming service for financial trades. Multiple producers enqueue trades into a bounded buffer; a small pool of workers applies risk checks and routes trades to downstream systems. Design a concurrency solution that guarantees per-instrument total ordering, backpressure, and fault-tolerance with at-least-once semantics. Provide a runnable sketch in Rust or Java showing enqueue, per-instrument dispatch, and recovery via a durable log?</title>
