  <title>You’re deploying a multilingual Transformer model (1.5B params) with TensorFlow Serving on Kubernetes. Inputs include dense features and variable-length token IDs; the embedding table is too large for a single device. Propose a concrete, end-to-end serving design that hits sub-50 ms P95 latency under bursts, addressing: (1) embedding cache and shard strategy, (2) preprocessing and dynamic batching, (3) model optimization (quantization/TF-TRT vs FP16/FP32), (4) zero-downtime updates with versioned models, and (5) observability and retries. Include a minimal TF SavedModel signature sketch?</title>
