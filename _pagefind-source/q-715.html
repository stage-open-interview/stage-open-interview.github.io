  <title>In a distributed data-processing pipeline across three services Ingest (I), Compute (C), Persist (P), each event carries a 3-element vector clock. Given E1 at I with [2,0,1] and E2 at C with [1,3,0], decide whether E1 happened-before E2, E2 happened-before E1, or they are concurrent. Explain the rule and show the comparison. How would you scale this to N services and detect concurrency in large logs?</title>
