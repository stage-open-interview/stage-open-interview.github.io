  <title>Scenario: A three-service order flow (API gateway -&gt; inventory -&gt; payment) runs in one region. Design a CKNE-aware tracing approach where each service propagates a CKNE health signal in trace metadata and employs an adaptive sampling policy: base 10% with a health-adjusted factor that can raise sampling to 50% during degradation. Specify data structures for per-service health, the trace metadata payload, and a minute-by-minute workflow to compute health and adjust sampling for the next window. Provide a minimal code snippet showing the payload and health update logic?</title>
