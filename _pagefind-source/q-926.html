  <title>In a multi-region deployment (US-East, EU-West) for a high-throughput service, end-to-end latency spikes to 150–300 ms during peak hours while synthetic tests pass. You observe edge drops and retransmissions. Provide a practical plan to diagnose and mitigate network-related factors, including path MTU discovery, ECN, TCP congestion control, TLS handshakes, SNI/ALPN behavior, and load-balancing strategy across regions, with data you’d collect and initial fixes?</title>
