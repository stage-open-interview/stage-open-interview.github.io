  <title>Design a real-time monocular CV system for on-device streaming analysis: from a single RGB stream, jointly perform instance segmentation of people and vehicles, estimate their 3D pose relative to the camera, and predict per-frame motion blur to guide bitrate allocation for adaptive streaming. New content styles appear weekly; support 5-shot on-device adaptation with latency under 40 ms per frame on a mobile GPU. Describe architecture, data strategy, losses, adaptation workflow, and evaluation metrics?</title>
