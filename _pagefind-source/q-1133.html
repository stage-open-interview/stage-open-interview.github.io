  <title>Scenario: a constraint-satisfaction problem with four tasks A,B,C,D each can be in domains {Pending, Running, Done}. Constraints: (A = Done) → (B = Running); (B = Running) → (C = Done); (C = Pending) → (D = Running); and (A = Pending) ∨ (D = Done). Is there a feasible assignment with at least one Running? Explain reasoning and outline a backtracking algorithm with forward-checking and 3-valued propagation to decide arbitrary such constraint sets?</title>
