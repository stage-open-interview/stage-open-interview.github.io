  <title>Design a concurrent per-shard event processor for a real-time analytics pipeline: events arrive from multiple producers into N shards, each with a bounded queue and dedicated workers. Implement backpressure to prevent overflow, fairness across shards, and strict per-shard ordering. How would you verify ordering, backpressure, and starvation avoidance with realistic unit and integration tests?</title>
