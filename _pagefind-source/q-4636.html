  <title>Design an intermediate CNF certification scenario for a hybrid cloud service mesh: implement an end-to-end runtime attestation and upgrade gate for CNFs deployed across namespaces and clouds. Include (1) a lightweight in-pod sidecar that signs an attestation report with a KMS-backed key and posts to a central attestation service, (2) a trust policy validating image provenance and attestation against a root of trust, (3) a canary upgrade strategy with per-CNF rollback based on attestation and traffic signals, and (4) minimal config snippets to validate in one namespace before wider rollout?</title>
