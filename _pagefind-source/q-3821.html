  <title>You&#039;re building a real-time graph analytics platform that ingests edge events from IoT devices: fields include device_id, neighbor_id, ts, tenant_id, and edge_attrs (nested, evolving). Data lands per-tenant in object storage and must feed a lakehouse (Iceberg) with near-real-time graph views. Requirements: per-tenant isolation, late-arriving edges up to 12 hours, idempotent upserts for edge state, schema evolution for edge_attrs, and end-to-end data contracts with lineage. Compare Flink vs Spark for streaming, and outline testing, monitoring, and GDPR-delete handling?</title>
