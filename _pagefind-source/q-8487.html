  <title>In a multi-account, multi-region data lake used by Stripe, Discord, Uber, ingest millions of JSON events per minute from mobile apps into Kinesis Data Streams. Design an end-to-end pipeline to land data as Parquet in S3 with daily partitions, using AWS Glue for ETL and cataloging, and enable cross-account analytics with Lake Formation. Explain how you handle: schema evolution for changing event payloads, data quality checks and masking, end-to-end testing in a staging environment, and data lineage/monitoring?</title>
