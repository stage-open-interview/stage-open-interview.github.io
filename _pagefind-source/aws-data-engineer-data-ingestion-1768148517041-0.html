  <title>You are designing a data ingestion pipeline for streaming IoT telemetry. The system must ingest up to 15,000 events per second, apply on-the-fly transformations to standardize the payloads, and store the results in S3 in Parquet format for Athena queries. The input schema evolves over time with new fields, and you want minimal maintenance when fields are added. Which architecture best meets these requirements?</title>
