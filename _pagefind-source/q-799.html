  <title>Scenario: four booleans P, Q, R, S where P = user has role X, Q = grants read, R = has role Y, S = grants write. Constraints: (P -&gt; Q), (R -&gt; S), (P ∨ R), and at least two of {Q,S} must be true. Is there a satisfying assignment? If yes, give one; if not, explain why. Then outline a minimal backtracking strategy with unit propagation for arbitrary similar constraint sets?</title>
