  <title>Design a high‑performance React Native feature: an app used by field crews showing a dynamic top‑k shipments list (top 100 by urgency) with intermittent connectivity. Propose an architecture that minimizes bridge crosses, uses local persistence (SQLite) with an on‑device delta applier via a native module (TurboModule/Fabric) or WASM, and a streaming delta protocol (WebSocket or SSE) with backpressure and offline replay. Include a concrete API for a hook useTopK(region, k, opts) and a minimal UI snippet showing usage, plus key trade‑offs and testing plan?</title>
