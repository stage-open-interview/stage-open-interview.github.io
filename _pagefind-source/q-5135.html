  <title>Design an Android module for a robotics companion app that streams high-rate sensor data with offline-first, energy-aware adaptive sampling. Describe: data model in Room for raw and summarized frames, on-device feature extraction, per-device signing keys in Android Keystore with nightly rotation and HMAC integrity, and a WorkManager-based reconciliation when online. Include an API surface for session state and last sync; what would you implement first?</title>
