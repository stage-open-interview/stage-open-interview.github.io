  <title>In a global telemetry pipeline over UDP QUIC, edge collectors in three regions send to a central sink through cloud regions. During peak hours, tail latency spikes appear with no app changes. The path includes NIC offloads (GSO/TSO), IRQ coalescing, and hypervisor scheduling. Provide a concrete diagnostic plan to distinguish NIC offloads, interrupt coalescing, and scheduler jitter, with exact commands and data to collect, and a robust mitigation that preserves throughput and latency, without changing app code?</title>
