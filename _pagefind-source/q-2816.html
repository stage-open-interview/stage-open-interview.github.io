  <title>Scenario: In a smart factory, 10 microphones capture a noisy, moving-robot environment with intermittent channel dropouts. Design a real-time streaming ICA pipeline that remains stable when channels fail. Include: (i) convolutional mixing model with frame-based processing, (ii) whitening strategy, (iii) online demixing with a 10×10 matrix, (iv) choice between per-bin ICA vs joint diagonalization, (v) handling of missing channels, and (vi) evaluation plan with ground-truth sources and latency targets?</title>
