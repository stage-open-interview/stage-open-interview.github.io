  <title>Advanced Snowflake-core: Ingesting daily into RAW.transactions (tx_id STRING, user_id STRING, tenant_id STRING, amount NUMBER, tx_ts TIMESTAMP_NTZ). Implement per-tenant analytics window of 18 months; archive data older than 18 months to an external stage ARCHIVE_STAGE (e.g., s3://archive-bucket/tenant_archive) while keeping recent data in Snowflake for dashboards. Design end-to-end using Streams, Tasks, and zero-copy cloning, with MV for aggregated views. Provide exact SQL to: (1) create archival objects and external stage, (2) a daily TASK that moves older data to ARCHIVE, (3) validation checks counting archived vs source, (4) restricted access via views/masking to archival data, and (5) rollback plan.
