  <title>Design a CI/CD pipeline for a hybrid cloud application that runs on both on-premises Kubernetes clusters and cloud-managed services (like AWS EKS). The pipeline must handle compliance requirements, maintain consistent deployments across environments, and support disaster recovery with automated failover.
