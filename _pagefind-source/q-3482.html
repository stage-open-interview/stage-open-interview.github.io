  <title>You’re deploying a TensorFlow Serving model for real-time image classification on Kubernetes; traffic is bursty and latency SLOs must be met. Describe how you would configure dynamic batching in TF Serving, including batching_parameters_file settings (max_batch_size and batch_timeout_millis) and how you would validate throughput and latency under bursty load?</title>
