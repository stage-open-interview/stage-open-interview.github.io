  <title>You&#039;re designing a dbt analytics pipeline for an e-commerce platform. The &#039;staging.events_raw&#039; table ingests page views and purchases and is partitioned by day. Data arrives both on time and as late as 24 hours. Design a practical incremental dbt model &#039;analytics.daily_sales&#039; that aggregates revenue by day, category, and customer_segment. Explain how you&#039;d implement incremental logic, handle late data, guard against schema drift, and validate with tests and snapshots?</title>
