  <title>As Azure Solutions Architect for a Meta-scale mobile game analytics platform, design a latency-bound telemetry path that ingests millions of events per second from players via MQTT over WebSockets to a regional Azure IoT Hub, streams to Event Hubs, and processes with Spark Structured Streaming in Synapse. Cache hot aggregates in Azure Redis in-region and persist raw/aggregated data to ADLS Gen2. Address regional residency, BYOK, DR, and cost controls. What components and data flow would you implement first and why?</title>
