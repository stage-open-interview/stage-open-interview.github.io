  <title>Scenario: You’re building a tiny policy engine for feature flags with three booleans A, B, C. Constraints: A implies B, B implies C, and at least two of the three must be true. Is there an assignment that satisfies all constraints? If so, give one example and briefly justify. Then outline a straightforward backtracking approach to enumerate all satisfying assignments for any n flags and any such constraints?</title>
