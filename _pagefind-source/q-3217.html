  <title>Design a per-session ordered event dispatcher for a real-time multiplayer game server. Each game session has its own FIFO queue; multiple producers can enqueue events across sessions, and a fixed-size pool of worker threads processes events. Requirements: (1) preserve strict per-session order; (2) allow cross-session work-stealing for load balancing; (3) enforce a global bounded queue with backpressure to producers; (4) support dynamic session creation/destruction with zero deadlock and graceful shutdown; (5) discuss memory reclamation and safety?</title>
