  <title>You&#039;re designing a real-time analytics pipeline on Azure for a multi-tenant fintech app. Ingest 100k events/sec via Azure Event Hubs, process with Functions and Durable Functions writing Delta Lake on ADLS Gen2, ensuring per-tenant isolation. Implement tenant-scoped encryption using customer-managed keys in Azure Key Vault, envelope encryption in the write path, and rotate keys with automated policies. How would you design key governance, access control, and latency considerations while maintaining observability and auditability?</title>
