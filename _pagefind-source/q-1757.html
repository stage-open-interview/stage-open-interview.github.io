  <title>Design a dbt analytics layer for three domains: core_events (user actions), memberships (plans), and referrals. Data arrives late (up to 2 days). Propose an architecture that ensures: 1) incremental models with controlled late data backfills, 2) deterministic surrogate keys for cross-domain joins, 3) schema-drift guards via custom tests/macros, 4) automated docs with complete lineage, 5) dashboard-friendly exposure with stable lineage during backfills, and 6) performance considerations for Snowflake or BigQuery (partitioning, clustering). Include a concrete incremental SQL snippet?</title>
