  <title>Dynamic 2D convex hull with batch insertions: Points arrive online in batches of size B; no deletions. After each batch, determine whether a query point p lies inside the current hull. Propose a practical incremental data structure that (i) preprocesses near-linearly, (ii) updates hull amortized O(B log n), (iii) answers point-in-hull in O(log n) (or O(1) with tradeoffs), (iv) uses near-linear space, (v) includes two optimizations, and (vi) compares to recomputing hull after every batch. What are the asymptotics in terms of n, B, and two-dimensional hull size h?</title>
