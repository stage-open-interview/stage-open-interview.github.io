  <title>Scenario: you implement a DR pattern across regions. A primary repo in us-east-1 exports VPC data via remote state. A DR repo in us-west-2 must read these values as read-only data sources and not modify primary resources. Design the Terraform pattern with per-env backends, a provider alias for the primary region, and a CI gate that blocks any plan that would create/modify resources in the primary region. Include minimal snippets for the data bridge and gating logic?</title>
