  <title>Design a global data ingestion and governance pipeline for a real-time ad-tech platform that processes 200k events/sec from 3 cloud regions into a centralized lakehouse. Each event has event_id, tenant_id, timestamp, event_type, and payload. Requirements: enforce data contracts via a central registry (schema + compatibility rules), support schema evolution with automatic catalog updates, and ensure multi-tenant data isolation and access control. Implement partitioning by tenant/date, handle late-arriving data within a 1–2 minute SLA, ensure data lineage and quality checks, and provide rollback semantics for contracts. Compare Iceberg vs Delta as the storage layer, outline testing/monitoring, and describe concrete example schemas and contract definitions. Include how you&#039;d validate end-to-end?</title>
