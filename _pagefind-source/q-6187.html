  <title>You&#039;re operating a mission-critical multi-region API on GKE with clusters in us-central1 and us-east1 behind a Google Cloud Load Balancer. Release v2 via Google Cloud Deploy with progressive delivery: Stage 1: 5% traffic in us-central1 for 10m; Stage 2: 25% across both regions for 20m; Stage 3: 100% if no degradation. Provide exact steps for building/pushing to Artifact Registry, configuring the Cloud Deploy pipeline, per-stage traffic shaping, per-regions Cloud Monitoring SLOs (p95 latency ≤1.2s, error rate ≤0.3% for 5m), and auto-rollback to v1. Include minimal IAM roles needed and how rollback is triggered?</title>
