  <title>Design a crash‑consistent, lock‑free, bounded ring buffer in shared memory that acts as a persistent queue across restarts. It must be backed by a memory‑mapped file, use per‑slot CRCs, and a two‑phase commit so writers can resume after power loss. Describe enqueue/dequeue algorithms, restoration after crash, and how you handle memory ordering, reclamation of retired descriptors, and backpressure. Include a microbenchmark plan?</title>
