Build a beginner Dataflow-based pipeline that flattens nested payloads, validates required fields, deduplicates on event_id, writes to a BigQuery table partitioned by ingestion_date and clustered by tenant_id, routes malformed messages to a dead-letter Pub/Sub topic, archives originals to Cloud Storage, and supports a per-tenant 24h rollback by replaying from staging.
