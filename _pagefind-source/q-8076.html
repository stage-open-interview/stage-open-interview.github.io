  <title>In a smart factory, a 64-sensor vibration-monitoring network records motor noise, tool impacts, and structural vibrations. Sensors sample asynchronously with clock drift and occasional missing data; channel gains drift with temperature. Design an online ICA pipeline to separate machine-tool signatures from background vibrations. Include: (i) asynchronous whitening to manage time misalignment, (ii) decide per-bin ICA vs joint diagonalization across windows, (iii) demixer update cadence and dimensionality reduction, (iv) handling missing samples and sensor dropout, (v) evaluation plan with injected ground-truth fault signatures?</title>
