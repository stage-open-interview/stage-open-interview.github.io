  <title>Design a beginner-friendly hybrid connectivity pattern for three on-prem partners that must reach an Analytics API in AWS. Each partner has a dedicated VPC in us-east-1 and connects via Site-to-Site VPN to a central Transit Gateway. Traffic to the Analytics API must avoid internet egress and use per-partner isolation.
