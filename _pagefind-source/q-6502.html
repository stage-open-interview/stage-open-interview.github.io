  <title>Design a multi-tenant Azure AI assistant for a real-time risk-monitoring dashboard used by engineers at Google, Discord, and Goldman Sachs. It must support streaming responses from Azure OpenAI Service, enforce per-tenant data isolation (Cosmos DB), ground answers against a versioned risk knowledge base in Azure Blob, implement token-budget gating and dynamic throttling, drift-detection across regions for both prompts and retrieved knowledge, and an automated audit trail with policy-compliance checks. Outline end-to-end data paths, components, and a rigorous test plan?</title>
