  <title>In a high-stakes data migration from MongoDB to Snowflake for analytics, a data quality alert surfaces mid-cutover while regulatory logging and residency constraints require zero data loss. Describe a STAR plan to isolate the issue, decide on a rollback vs continuation, coordinate with Security/Compliance, implement a corrective delta, and verify data integrity before resuming.
