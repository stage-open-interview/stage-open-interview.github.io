  <title>Design an algorithm to compute the shortest s→t distance in a directed, weighted graph with non-negative weights, where you may set the weight of at most K edges along the chosen path to 0 (free passes). Edges beyond K must keep their original weights. Provide a function signature and a compact code sketch, discuss data structures, and analyze time/memory complexity. Include path reconstruction and edge cases?</title>
