  <title>You&#039;re building a social-network analytics service. The directed graph G=(V,E) has n nodes and m edges. Edges arrive online in batches of size B (no deletions). After each batch, design a practical incremental approximate betweenness centrality system using a fixed landmark set of size s to bound error ε with probability 1-δ. The system should preprocess, update amortized per batch, answer top-k queries quickly, use near-linear space, include two optimizations, and compare to recomputing Brandes after each batch. Provide asymptotics in n,m,B,s,ε,δ?</title>
