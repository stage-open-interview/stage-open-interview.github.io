  <title>On a Linux host running a real-time audio processing pipeline that must meet deterministic latency, a single 8-core CPU shows occasional dropouts during peak input. Design a production plan to guarantee latency isolation for the critical path: specify hardware topology, kernel boot params (isolcpus, nohz_full), IRQ affinity, CPU sets, cgroups v2 with a dedicated rt.slice using SCHED_FIFO priorities, memory locking, and a test plan with cyclictest and a synthetic workload simulating 16-channel 192 kHz audio. What exact steps would you take and how would you verify?</title>
