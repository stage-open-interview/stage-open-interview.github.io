  <title>Scenario: A Linux host with two NUMA nodes runs a latency‑sensitive service in containers. During bursts, 99th percentile latency climbs from ~1 ms to 40 ms while CPU, I/O, and network look fine. Using only default Linux tools, design a concrete diagnostic workflow to (1) confirm cross‑NUMA memory access or bandwidth saturation as the cause, (2) identify the container(s)/cgroups driving the contention, and (3) apply a safe mitigation (e.g., pin critical services to node0 and migrate others) while preserving observability. Include exact commands and example outputs?</title>
