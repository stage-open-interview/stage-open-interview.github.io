  <title>You&#039;re building a real-time data ingestion pipeline that must apply a sequence of transformations to each record. New transforms (normalization, enrichment, validation, anomaly detection) should be added as plugins without touching producer/consumer code. Design a pluggable Transform pipeline with per-tenant routing and hot-reload of configuration. Provide minimal interface and a usage example, including how to configure a few plugins and compose them for a stream?</title>
