  <title>Scenario: On a single host, implement a blue-green deployment for a stateless API behind an Nginx reverse proxy using docker-compose. Start with green (v1) receiving all traffic; deploy blue (v2) and switch traffic to blue only after a 30-second health-check window confirms readiness, ensuring zero downtime. Provide: a) docker-compose.yml with two API services (api-green and api-blue) and Nginx, b) nginx.conf with a switchable upstream, c) a Bash script upgrade.sh that promotes blue by reconfiguring upstream and reloading Nginx, d) exact commands to bring up green, deploy blue, run the upgrade, and verify with curl?</title>
