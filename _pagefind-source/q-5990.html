  <title>CNPA stack with HTTP API, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis, and a real-time dashboard. A new feature requires cross-service event correlation via a correlation_id across HTTP requests, DB writes, and Kafka messages. Under peak load correlation occasionally fails, breaking traceability. Design a beginner-friendly plan to guarantee correlation_id propagation and end-to-end tracing, detailing: where to pass headers, how to store in Postgres, how to embed into Kafka headers, how to propagate to Redis cache, and how to verify end-to-end traces?</title>
