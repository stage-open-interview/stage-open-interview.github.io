  <title>You&#039;re building a multi-region, multi-tenant SaaS on Azure that must support customers across two regions with data residency per tenant. Each tenant gets an isolated Kubernetes namespace on a dedicated AKS cluster, managed via GitOps, while a shared API gateway routes to per-tenant services. Outline an end to end design including: per-tenant namespaces and RBAC, isolation via private endpoints and network policies, per-tenant data stores and secret management, Terraform-based CI/CD with GitHub Actions, Azure Policy tagging and least privilege, cross-tenant access via Azure Lighthouse, budget alerts per tenant, and DR with region pairs. How would you implement?</title>
