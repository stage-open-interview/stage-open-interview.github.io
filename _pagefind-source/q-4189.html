  <title>Grid path with constrained turns. You have an R x C grid with non-negative weights. Start at (0,0) and end at (R-1,C-1). You can move only right or down. You must make exactly k turns (a turn is when you switch from moving right to down or from down to right). Return the minimum path sum, or -1 if impossible. Propose a DP formulation using states dp[i][j][dir][t], with dir in {0,1} representing last move direction, t turns used. Include recurrences, base cases, reconstruction, and time/space analysis?</title>
