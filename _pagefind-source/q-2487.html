  <title>Design a KCA workflow for 100k industrial IoT devices deployed across 5 regions, each with a hardware-backed root and device attestation. Devices enroll via a one-time token and CSR, obtain a 1-year client certificate with per-device scoping, and refresh every 6 hours. Include policy propagation through a streaming config service, cross-region trust, revocation via OCSP/CRLs, offline root fallback, auditing, and a concrete 1-page test plan. Ensure resilience against device compromise and root loss?</title>
