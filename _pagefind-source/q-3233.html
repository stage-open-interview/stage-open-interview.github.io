  <title>In a Terraform Cloud/Enterprise setup with dozens of teams and modules, design a policy-as-code gated workflow to enforce security and cost constraints across all workspaces. Explain how you would structure policy packs (Sentinel or OPA), gate per environment, handle computed attributes in plans, and provide a concrete policy snippet that blocks public S3 buckets and enforces KMS CMKs. How would you test and rollback?</title>
