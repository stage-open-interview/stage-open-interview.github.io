  <title>You&#039;re performance testing a PayPal-like payment gateway that uses a gateway → auth → fraud → settlement chain, with MongoDB as the transaction store (sharded) and Kafka for events. Peak load: 2000 TPS with 4x burst. How would you design a test plan to validate end-to-end latency, idempotency, backpressure, and circuit breaker behavior under partial service degradation (fraud service slow, DB shard hot), including topology, workloads, and success criteria?</title>
