  <title>You&#039;re evaluating a privacy-preserving on-device NLP summarizer that runs on user devices with federated updates to a central model via secure aggregation. Design a 2-year cost-benefit model for deploying across Android and iOS in 4 regions with ~25M MAU. Include capex for secure enclaves and on-device storage, opex for federated aggregation and governance, update bandwidth, regulatory penalties for leakage, and uplift in engagement. Provide break-even and go/no-go criteria?</title>
