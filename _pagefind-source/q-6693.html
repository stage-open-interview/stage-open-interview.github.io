  <title>Channel: backend/caching
Difficulty: advanced
You&#039;re building a multi-service e-commerce backend where product data is cached in Redis and accessed by catalog, pricing, and inventory services. Design a cache invalidation strategy that tolerates high write throughput and eventual consistency. Explain how you implement: (1) per-type TTLs and versioned keys, (2) cross-service invalidation via Redis pub/sub or streams, (3) tombstone records to prevent stale reads, (4) race-condition handling and idempotence, and (5) observability. Include a concrete key data structure and a minimal code snippet for generating a cache key and invalidating on update?</title>
