  <title>Scenario: A Terraform repo uses a module named network that creates subnets via for_each over a map of subnet_id to name. Three subnets were created manually (subnet-aaa, subnet-bbb, subnet-ccc) and must be brought under Terraform control without changing the rest. Describe exact steps and commands to import only these existing subnets into the module state, update the for_each map to include their IDs, and verify drift with a full plan. Include init/plan/apply commands and how to handle dependent resources (route tables, tags)?</title>
