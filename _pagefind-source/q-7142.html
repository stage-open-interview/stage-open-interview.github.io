A directive demands a 50% reduction in production incidents while keeping feature velocity. Propose a concrete end-to-end plan: reliability maturity model per squad, a Platform Reliability Engineering (PRE) CoE, a measurement suite (MTTR, error budgets, P95 latency, deploy success), a two-stream rollout, rituals, milestones, and go/no-go criteria within a 10–12 week window.
