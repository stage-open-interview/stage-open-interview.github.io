  <title>You&#039;re building an Azure IoT telemetry platform for a global fleet. Devices send 20–30k events/sec to IoT Hub. You need per-tenant isolation, real-time enrichment (geolocation, device type), and fan-out to three sinks: Delta Lake on ADLS Gen2, Azure Data Explorer dashboards, and an AI inference service on AKS. Must guarantee at-least-once semantics, handle out-of-order data, and support cross-region DR with measurable RPO. Compare two architectures: (A) serverless micro-batch: IoT Hub → Event Hubs → Functions for lightweight enrichment; Spark Structured Streaming writes to Delta Lake on ADLS Gen2; sinks feed Data Explorer and AKS inference. (B) pure streaming: Event Hubs → Spark Structured Streaming with larger cluster, stricter SLAs, and end-to-end exactly-once semantics. Explain data models, failure modes, and governance?</title>
