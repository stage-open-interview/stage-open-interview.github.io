  <title>Given an array A[1..n] and an integer k, choose exactly k non-empty, non-overlapping contiguous blocks. For each block [l..r], you may replace all elements in the block by a single value x chosen to minimize the sum of absolute deviations within that block; the block cost is sum_{i=l}^r |A[i]-x|, achieved at x = median(A[l..r]). Return the minimum total cost and the endpoints of the k blocks. Propose a DP formulation, including base cases, recurrences, and how to reconstruct the blocks; discuss time and space?</title>
