  <title>Design an end-to-end incremental ELT pipeline on Azure that ingests 2 TB/day of nested JSON telemetry from Event Hubs into a Delta Lake on ADLS Gen2, then loads a star schema in Azure Synapse. Requirements: (1) schema drift tolerant writes and schema evolution, (2) upserts by a composite key (tenant_id, event_id), (3) end-to-end data lineage to Purview, (4) late-arriving data support via watermarking, (5) partitioning by region and day with file-size/compaction strategies. Which components and patterns would you use, and why? Compare Delta Lake MERGE vs Delete+Insert for upserts?</title>
