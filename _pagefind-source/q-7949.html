  <title>In a two-site VPN over the Internet, a new UDP telemetry stream from Site A to Site B intermittently drops during peak hours. No app changes. Provide a concrete diagnostic plan to determine whether (a) tunnel MTU fragmentation, (b) IPsec anti-replay/replay window, (c) NAT state exhaustion on egress, or (d) ECMP hashing across multiple tunnels is to blame, with exact commands and data to collect, and propose robust mitigations that preserve telemetry reliability?</title>
