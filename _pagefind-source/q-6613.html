  <title>You&#039;re leading 6 squads at a Stripe/Uber-like company. A critical external authentication provider reliability issue causes peak-time login failures. Design a concrete remediation plan: quick stabilization with local fallbacks and circuit breakers, a long-term migration to a self-hosted auth module with phased, region-aware rollout, and governance across telemetry, incident mgmt, and release engineering. Include a 12-week milestone plan, go/no-go criteria, and the metrics you would watch (login success rate, error budget burn, MTTR, latency). Outline the first 3 experiments to validate readiness and avoid metric gaming?</title>
