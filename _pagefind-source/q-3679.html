  <title>Design an Android module for a live, synchronized music player that allows nearby devices to form a low-latency playback mesh using Nearby Connections, while seamlessly falling back to a central streaming server when devices are out of range. Requirements: Kotlin, Coroutines, ExoPlayer for playback, Room for an offline queue, per-device signing keys stored in Android Keystore with nightly rotation, and a WorkManager-based reconciliation when back online. Describe architecture, data flow, synchronization protocol for drift, conflict resolution, and a concrete test plan for clock drift, churn, and offline queue recovery?</title>
