  <title>KCNA per-tenant encryption &amp; key management: design a CMEK-backed model for KCNA where each tenant&#039;s event payload is encrypted at ingestion with per-tenant keys managed by an external KMS. How would you implement key rotation without downtime, revocation, and auditable proofs (Merkle-based) without exposing payloads? Include data structures mapping tenants to keys, API surfaces, and a practical test plan?</title>
