  <title>Implement an asynchronous Python processor that ingests JSON lines representing user actions from a streaming source. Each line contains user_id, action, timestamp. Build per-user sessions defined as activities within 5 minutes of each other; emit a session when the user has been idle for 5 minutes or when action == &#039;logout&#039;. Ensure memory-bounded operation, in-order per user, handle late events within a bounded lateness L seconds, and apply backpressure to the source. Provide tests and discuss trade-offs?</title>
