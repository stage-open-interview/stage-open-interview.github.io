  <title>You have a 16‑mic array in a live broadcast over a lossy wireless link. Design an online ICA pipeline that runs on edge devices to separate sources in real time. Address: (i) asynchronous frame alignment and missing samples, (ii) maintaining consistent cross-bin permutation under variable latency, (iii) forgetting-factor whitening with an adaptive window, (iv) deciding between per-bin ICA vs joint diagonalization in streaming, and (v) a practical evaluation plan with ground-truth sources and perceptual quality metrics?</title>
