  <title>In a Linux kernel driver for a PCIe DMA device, the host uses a shared descriptor ring with the device. A producer thread writes descriptors and updates a head pointer; the device consumes descriptors and raises an interrupt on completion. Describe a concrete interleaving that could yield a lost or out-of-order completion if there is no proper synchronization between producer writes and device processing. Propose a minimal fix using per-descriptor sequence numbers and memory barriers (e.g., smp_wmb, dma_wmb) and explain how this guarantees in-order, at-least-once completion, including cache coherence and DMA semantics?</title>
