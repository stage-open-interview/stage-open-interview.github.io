  <title>You&#039;re orchestrating a progressive rollout for two Cloud Run services, A and B, that are part of a shared feature flag. Use Cloud Deploy to run a canary of v2 across both services with a 25% traffic allocation for 30 minutes, then 80% for 15 minutes, and full rollout if latency p95 stays under 0.8s and error rate under 0.4%. If either metric breaches for two consecutive 5-minute windows, automatically rollback to v1 by routing 100% of traffic back to v1 for both services. Outline exact steps: 1) build/push images to Artifact Registry, 2) Cloud Deploy manifest for multi-service release, 3) traffic-split and rollout timings, 4) Cloud Monitoring alerting thresholds and auto-rollback gate, 5) region handling/us-central1, 6) minimal IAM roles and Secrets/CMEK usage?</title>
