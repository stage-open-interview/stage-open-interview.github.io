  <title>Advanced CNF certification: You operate a multi-tenant CNF platform on Kubernetes at scale. Design an end-to-end license-attestation and update-workflow that guarantees every deployed CNF carries a tenant-specific license attestation, validated at admission and runtime, and upgrades are gated accordingly. The flow should (1) generate a tenant-scoped SBOM at build using a KMS-backed key, (2) sign the image with Cosign and attach the SBOM, (3) publish a per-tenant update manifest signed by the tenant referencing the SBOM and license, (4) enforce with OPA/Kyverno policies that only attested updates proceed, and (5) include a minimal in-namespace test and a rollback path to the previous image. Provide concrete steps and minimal manifests?</title>
