  <title>In a multi-account AWS setup, centralize a logs bucket in Account A that stores CloudTrail and VPC Flow Logs from Accounts B and C. All objects must be encrypted at rest with a CMK in Account A that rotates automatically. Design the KMS key policy, bucket policy, and cross-account IAM roles to allow Account B/C services to encrypt, while preventing decryption except via a centralized IAM role in Account A. Include how you would validate encryption, rotation status, and auditability?</title>
