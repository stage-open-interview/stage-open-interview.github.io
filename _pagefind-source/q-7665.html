  <title>Design an end-to-end API test strategy for a multi-region order service where POST /orders creates an order and emits events to downstream services via Kafka. The plan should cover idempotency, out-of-order event handling, cross-region data consistency, and failure modes under chaos engineering (network partitions, partial outages, retries with backoff). Include concrete test cases, tooling, and observability requirements?</title>
