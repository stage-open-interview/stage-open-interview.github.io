  <title>Design a KCA workflow for a multi-tenant Kubernetes-based ML training and serving platform. Each training job pod and model-serving worker boots with a hardware-backed root, attests to a regional bootstrap service, and enrolls a CSR to a central KCA issuing a short-lived TLS cert (TTL 600s) bound to a per-run SPIFFE ID and an &#039;ml&#039; scope. Include cross-region trust anchors, crypto agility (PQC fallback), revocation, auditing, and a test plan for pod rescheduling and reattestation latency?</title>
