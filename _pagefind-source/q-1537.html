  <title>You&#039;re building a React Native app for field engineers in regulated environments. It collects GPS and accelerometer telemetry, signs each record with a device key, and batches uploads to a backend with offline-first guarantees and tamper-evident auditing. Describe the architecture, data flow, and provide a small code sketch: a LocalAuditLog module backed by SQLite and TweetNaCl for Ed25519 signing, plus a transport adapter with exponential backoff and key-rotation handling. Include edge cases around tenant isolation, data retention, and replay protection?</title>
