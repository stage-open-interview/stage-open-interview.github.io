  <title>In a two-region AWS SAP HANA on EC2 deployment (primary us-east-1, DR eu-west-1) with strict data residency, design an automated DR workflow that keeps SAP HANA in sync, ensures RPO/RTO targets, and validates continuity after failover. Include: replication strategy (HSR with synchronous commit), backups to cross-region S3 with KMS, IAM roles across accounts, patching windows, and a DR test procedure. Provide a minimal IaC snippet to create cross-region roles and buckets?</title>
