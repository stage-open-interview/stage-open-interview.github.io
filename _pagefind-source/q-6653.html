  <title>Design an intermediate concurrency interview problem: implement a three-stage streaming pipeline with bounded buffers: Ingress with N producers emits keyed records into a first queue; Transformer stage with M workers applies stateless processing; Aggregator stage with K workers computes per-key aggregates. Guarantee per-key in-order processing across all stages under backpressure, support dynamic worker resizing, and define a clear policy for late or out-of-order messages. Provide data structures and a concrete test plan?</title>
