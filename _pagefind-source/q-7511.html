  <title>You&#039;re deploying a nightly Cloud Run Job named daily-processor. Using only Google-native tools, design a minimal CI/CD: build container image, push to Artifact Registry, deploy the Cloud Run Job, and set Cloud Scheduler to trigger nightly at 02:00. Add a log-based metric for job failures and a Cloud Monitoring alert if failures occur in a 24h window. Include minimal IAM permissions and a quick test plan. How would you implement this end-to-end?</title>
