  <title>Design an end-to-end ingestion and analytics pipeline for 20 TB/day of nested JSON events from 100 clinics across jurisdictions. Each event contains patient data with optional fields. Build a streaming path (Kafka -&gt; Flink) into a lakehouse (Iceberg) with per-tenant data contracts, dynamic schema evolution, and per-country residency. Implement idempotent upserts into a dimensional model, support late events up to 30 minutes, and a field-level masking policy that varies by tenant and region. Compare Spark Structured Streaming vs Flink for this workload and outline testing, monitoring, and data-quality checks?</title>
