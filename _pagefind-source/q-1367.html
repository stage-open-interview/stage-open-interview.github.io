  <title>You\&#039;re managing 100 AWS subnets defined in a single Terraform module using for_each. A drift occurred in one subnet\&#039;s route_table_id because it was changed outside Terraform. Describe exactly how you\&#039;d detect the drift and fix only that resource with zero-drift impact, using Terraform CLI commands. Include the exact commands to init plan, taint the resource, apply with -target, and re-run a full plan to confirm drift-free state?</title>
