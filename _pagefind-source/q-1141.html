  <title>For an industrial IoT fleet of 50k field devices with intermittent connectivity, design a KCA workflow where each device boots with a hardware-backed key and obtains a short-lived client certificate from a central CA via an attestation-enabled bootstrap. Include enrollment, attestation checks, certificate lifetimes (6 hours), automatic renewal after reconnection, revocation for decommissioned devices via OCSP/CRLs, offline root fallback, auditing, and a minimal test plan?</title>
