  <title>Scenario: You manage a single Terraform module that provisions a Google Cloud DNS managed zone with multiple A records across environments (dev, staging, prod) using a map variable and a for_each on google_dns_record_set. A drift occurred in prod: the IP of prod A record was manually changed outside Terraform. Describe exact steps to detect drift and fix only prod&#039;s A record using Terraform CLI with init/plan/apply and a -target run, then re-run a full plan to confirm drift-free state. Include the exact resource address to target?</title>
