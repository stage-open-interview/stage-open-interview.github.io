  <title>In a multi-GPU TensorFlow 2.x training job using tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy across 4 GPUs, you need to emulate a larger batch size by gradient accumulation because memory limits prevent a larger batch. Provide a concrete setup: where to accumulate, when to trigger optimizer steps, how to adjust the LR schedule (e.g., linear warmup, LR scaling with accumulation), how to ensure per-replica gradients combine correctly, and how you would save/restore checkpoints to remain consistent across workers. Include a minimal code sketch?</title>
