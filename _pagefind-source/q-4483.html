  <title>You have a transformer-based text classifier served via TensorFlow Serving on Kubernetes. To handle bursts with latency under 20 ms, design an end-to-end serving approach using dynamic batching, on-the-fly padding, and a small cache for recent embeddings. Include how you&#039;d configure the model server, enable zero-downtime updates with versioning, and how you&#039;d monitor tail latency. What would be your concrete plan?</title>
