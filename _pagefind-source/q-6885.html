  <title>Ingest 50M+ events per day into RAW.telemetry(device_id STRING, ts TIMESTAMP_NTZ, payload VARIANT). Analysts require per-device 5-minute rolling event counts and median payload size over the last hour, with dashboards refreshing every minute. Design a production plan with data model (RAW vs CURATED), clustering, streams, and tasks for incremental aggregates, and a strategy for late data and cost control. Include exact commands for one incremental materialized view and a 5-minute refresh task?</title>
