  <title>You are assigned a brand-new cross-functional squad to ship a data-privacy feature across services (GDPR/CCPA consent capture and redaction) with minimal latency impact. You have 4 weeks, three squads (Backend, Frontend, Data Engineering) and one external auditor. How do you bootstrap governance, define success metrics, and mitigate risk while preserving cadence? Provide concrete artifacts (backlog items, Definition of Ready, risk register) and the first three experiments to validate readiness, plus how you coordinate dependencies?</title>
