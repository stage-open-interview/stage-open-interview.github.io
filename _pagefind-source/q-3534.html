  <title>A 4-microphone conference-room recording experiences slow gain drift and moving sources; design a beginner ICA pipeline that (i) uses short-time Fourier domain whitening with per-frame gain normalization to counter drift, (ii) performs online 4×4 demixing for two sources, (iii) chooses between per-bin ICA and joint diagonalization, (iv) tracks nonstationary mixing across frames with a lightweight estimator, and (v) specifies a latency target plus an evaluation plan with ground-truth SDR/SIR — all in a practical, implementable way?</title>
