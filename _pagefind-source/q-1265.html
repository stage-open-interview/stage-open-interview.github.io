  <title>You&#039;re building a real-time collaborative whiteboard in React Native that must support up to 1,000 participants with low latency and offline fallback. Describe an end-to-end architecture using WebRTC data channels for deltas, WebSocket signaling, and a CRDT for merging concurrent strokes. Include data model (stroke encoding, timestamps), backpressure handling, and a small code sketch implementing a delta encoder and an in-app delta queue that feeds an RN Canvas/Skia surface, with clear acceptance criteria?</title>
