  <title>Scenario: a high-traffic Linux service behind a reverse proxy experiences sporadic tail latency spikes during peak hours. CPU and IO look normal in aggregate. Design a practical end-to-end diagnostic using eBPF to identify root causes quickly: (1) instrument per-request latency across kernel and user-space, (2) attribute latency to network, disk, or app code, (3) propose safe mitigations and validate impact. Include specific probes, sample commands, and expected outputs?</title>
