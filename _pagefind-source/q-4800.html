  <title>Context: A Snap/Instacart-like multi-tenant SaaS builds Docker images in CI for tenants and deploys to a shared Kubernetes cluster. A secret accidentally ends up baked into an image and could be used to reach other tenants. Propose a beginner-friendly security plan focusing on: 1) per-tenant image signing/verification, 2) SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning in CI, 3) runtime secret management to avoid secrets baked into images, 4) an admission control gating for only signed images, and 5) a 48-hour IR playbook for baked secrets. Include concrete steps, tooling, and success criteria?</title>
