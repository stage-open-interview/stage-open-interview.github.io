  <title>You&#039;re modeling a real-time collaboration network. The undirected graph has n nodes; edges arrive in batches of size B. After each batch, report the current number of connected components. Propose a DSU-based solution with path compression and union by size, analyze preprocessing time and memory, per-batch update time for B unions, total memory, and compare to recomputing CC from scratch after every batch. Express asymptotics in terms of n, m, B, and α(n)?</title>
