  <title>Design a tiny access-control graph with four nodes R1..R4; each node&#039;s state is True, False, or Unknown (T, F, U). Policy edges: R1→R2, (R3 ∨ R4) is required, and ¬R4 → R1. Is there an assignment with at least one U such that all constraints avoid being definitively False under Kleene 3-valued semantics? Propose a 3-valued propagation algorithm (fixpoint) to verify arbitrary sets of such rules, with a short walk-through on a small example?</title>
