  <title>In a multi-account AWS SAP deployment (HANA on EC2 + NetWeaver), design a serverless batch orchestration pattern triggered by S3 events that submits SAP ABAP batch jobs via an RFC bridge through a Lambda, with Step Functions coordinating retries. Ensure idempotent execution using a dedupeId, robust exponential backoff, and a compensating path to cancel a started job on downstream failure. Use STS AssumeRole for per-job credentials in the SAP operator account and emit a centralized audit trail to the security account. Include a minimal CloudFormation snippet to deploy the Step Functions state machine and the Lambda execution role?</title>
