  <title>Design and implement a cache-friendly tiled matrix multiply for two large double-precision matrices stored in row-major order on a two-socket NUMA system. Propose a tile size of 32x32, provide C code for the tiled kernel with boundary handling, explain how to maximize L1/L2 reuse, NUMA locality (first-touch), avoid false sharing, and an inline 4-wide inner-loop unrolling. Include a microbenchmark plan comparing to a naive triple-nested loop and how you would measure throughput and cache behavior?</title>
