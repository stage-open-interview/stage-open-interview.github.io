  <title>You&#039;re evaluating a cross-app data sharing feature that enables end-to-end encrypted, device-scoped data channels between a mobile app and a desktop app, governed by a user-managed consent ledger with revocation. The design must support offline eligibility checks and cross-platform identity binding. Build an 18-month CBA covering hardware-backed key storage costs, crypto compute, ledger maintenance, cross-platform data transfer, privacy penalties, and expected business impact; define go/no-go criteria and break-even horizon?</title>
