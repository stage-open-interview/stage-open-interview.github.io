  <title>You&#039;re given a string s of length n and an integer k. You may delete at most k characters from s. What is the maximum possible length of a palindromic subsequence in the remaining string? Provide a DP formulation using dp[i][j][d] as the max palindrome length in s[i..j] after exactly d deletions within that subrange. Include recurrences, base cases, reconstruction hints, and time/space complexities. Example: s = &quot;abca&quot;, k = 1?</title>
