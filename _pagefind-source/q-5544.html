  <title>Design a beginner iOS SwiftUI app named FocusFlow that starts a 25-minute focus timer, shows a circular progress indicator, and saves remaining seconds to UserDefaults on every app lifecycle change. On relaunch, restore the previous state (remaining time and running/paused). The app should resume automatically if it was running. Include a minimal test plan for persistence and state restoration?</title>
