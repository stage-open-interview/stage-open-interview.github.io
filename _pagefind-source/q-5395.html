  <title>In a data warehouse on Postgres, a fact_sales table is partitioned by month on sale_date. How would you craft an EXPLAIN ANALYZE-friendly plan for a query that filters sale_date between two dates and aggregates revenue by customer_id, ensuring partition pruning and efficient index use, with minimal cross-partition overhead? What changes if the date range spans many partitions and partitions are added mid-quarter?</title>
