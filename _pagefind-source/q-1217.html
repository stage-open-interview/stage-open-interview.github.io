  <title>You&#039;re building a budgeted prompt engine for a multilingual support bot. With a 60-token cap for prompts in English and Spanish, design a rule-based condenser that preserves intent, routes to one of three templates (concise, empathetic, clarifying), and rejects unsafe prompts. What would the architecture look like, and provide a minimal Python prototype that compresses input to fit the budget and demonstrates template routing?</title>
