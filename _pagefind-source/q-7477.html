  <title>You&#039;re building a gateway that accepts both SAML and OIDC tokens and issues per-service short-lived JWTs. Add a new requirement: support RFC 8693-style token exchange so a downstream service can obtain a scoped token on behalf of a user, with tenant isolation and token binding. Describe the concrete flow, including validation of source, claims mapping, exchange checks, token binding to client_id and a nonce, and key rotation/revocation strategy. Provide a minimal code snippet for generating the exchanged JWT?</title>
