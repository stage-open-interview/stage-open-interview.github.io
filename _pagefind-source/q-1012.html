  <title>In a churn prediction problem, you have 20k customers and 500 features (mix of binary indicators and continuous metrics). PCA will be used before a logistic regression model to predict churn. Describe an end-to-end plan to (1) handle missing values and mixed data types, (2) scale features appropriately, (3) choose the number of components with cross-validated downstream performance, (4) interpret the top loadings for business insight, and (5) guard against leakage and overfitting in a production pipeline?</title>
