  <title>Scenario: A streaming analytics service maintains a dynamic multiset of item scores. Online batches of B updates arrive (insertions and deletions). After each batch you must report the sum of the k largest scores. Propose a data structure and algorithm to support batch updates and a top-k-sum query with amortized O(log N) per update, describe how to maintain two balanced BSTs (TopK and Rest), how elements move between them, and provide space bounds. Compare to recomputing the top-k sum from scratch after every batch?</title>
