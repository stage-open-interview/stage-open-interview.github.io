  <title>On a single Linux host with NUMA, tail latency spikes under sustained load from a real-time event processor while CPU usage remains moderate. Using only default Linux tools, design a concrete diagnostic workflow to (1) confirm whether stalls are caused by Transparent Huge Pages or page cache thrashing, (2) identify the offending memory consumer and its allocations, and (3) apply a safe mitigation (e.g., disable THP, adjust swappiness, pin the hot thread) while preserving observability. Include exact commands and example outputs?</title>
