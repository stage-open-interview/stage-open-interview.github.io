  <title>Design an end-to-end test for a Zoom-like video conferencing flow that includes: meeting creation, host and participants joining via WebRTC, screen sharing, live captions, and chat. The scenario should simulate intermittent network conditions (latency, jitter, packet loss), user churn, and screen-sharing start mid-call. Outline data isolation, test data seeding, and actionable steps with concrete tooling: Playwright for UI, a mock signaling server, and synthetic WebRTC peers in headless browsers. Validate metrics: join time, rejoin latency, packet loss observed, caption integrity, and screen-share reliability?</title>
