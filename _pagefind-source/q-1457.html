  <title>You&#039;re building a real-time risk-scoring model for a multi-region e-commerce platform. The model consumes streaming events, uses SageMaker Feature Store for features, and is deployed as a real-time endpoint with cross-region routing. Describe a concrete end-to-end deployment and monitoring design that ensures deterministic latency, supports feature versioning, detects data drift, and handles canary rollouts with rollback triggers; include governance, cost controls, and testing strategy?</title>
