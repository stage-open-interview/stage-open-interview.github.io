  <title>In a web app, you capture stereo audio from a 2-mic headset during a cafe meetup where two people speak and wind noise is occasional. Design a beginner ICA pipeline that runs entirely in the browser (JavaScript/WebAudio) using 50% overlap frames of 1024 samples (assuming 44.1kHz), with (i) whitening, (ii) a simple online 2×2 ICA using tanh nonlinearity, (iii) frame-to-frame permutation alignment based on non-Gaussianity, and (iv) a lightweight adaptation to nonstationary noise. Include latency targets (&lt;80 ms) and a plan to evaluate with ground-truth SDR/SIR and listening checks?</title>
