  <title>Scenario: A Linux host runs Redis in a container and a data-processor in another container. Under peak load, tail latency spikes in Redis and memory bandwidth saturates on NUMA node0. Using only default tools, design a concrete diagnostic workflow to (1) confirm CPU/memory pressure is the cause, (2) pinpoint the exact CPUs and NUMA nodes involved, and (3) apply safe mitigations (e.g., pin critical services with cpuset, adjust CPU frequency governor, disable THP, enforce memcg limits) while preserving observability. Include exact commands and example outputs?</title>
