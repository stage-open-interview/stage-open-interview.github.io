  <title>In Linux, two processes share a 64-bit counter via a memory-mapped shared region (MAP_SHARED). Process A writes the counter as a single 64-bit write; Process B reads the counter once per second. Describe a concrete interleaving that yields a torn read on 32-bit architectures and explain why atomicity of 64-bit writes is not guaranteed there. Propose a minimal safe protocol to ensure atomicity and visibility, including exact operation order (atomic 64-bit ops vs version-tag approach)?</title>
