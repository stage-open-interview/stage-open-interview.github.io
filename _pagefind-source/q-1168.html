  <title>You’re building a TensorFlow model that jointly processes images and captions stored in a CSV with columns: image_path, caption, label. Implement an efficient tf.data pipeline that (1) reads the CSV, (2) loads and decodes images from disk with aspect-ratio-preserving resize to 224x224, (3) tokenizes captions using a saved BPE tokenizer loaded from a file, (4) pads captions to the max length within each batch, (5) caches, (6) shuffles with a fixed seed, (7) batches 64, (8) runs under a multi-GPU distribution strategy. Provide the core code blocks and discuss performance trade-offs?</title>
