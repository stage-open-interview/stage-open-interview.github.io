  <title>Design a dynamic weighted prefix-trie data structure to store a multiset of words with weights (duplicates allowed for same word and weight). Implement operations: insertWord(word, weight) and eraseWord(word, weight). For a given prefix p, provide (a) sumWeightsWithPrefix(p) = total weight of all words starting with p, and (b) kthLargestWeightWithPrefix(p, k) = k-th largest weight among those words. Target amortized O(len(word) log M) updates and O(log M) queries; describe data layout, per-prefix sums, how updates propagate, and how deletions are handled?</title>
