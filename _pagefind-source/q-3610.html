  <title>You run a Linux host with a small API service behind Nginx. During bursts, tail latency spikes even though CPU, memory, and network look normal. Using only default tooling, design a beginner-friendly diagnostic workflow to (1) determine if CPU, memory, or I/O wait is the bottleneck, (2) identify the exact process or disk causing the bottleneck, and (3) apply a safe mitigation (e.g., adjust I/O scheduler, tune dirty writeback, or scale workers) while preserving observability. Include exact commands and expected outputs?</title>
