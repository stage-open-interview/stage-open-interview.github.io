  <title>You&#039;re building a binary classifier to flag fraudulent transactions in a streaming feed and start with a simple logistic regression on features like amount, timestamp, and categorical encoding of merchant. Describe a beginner-friendly, end-to-end workflow to: (a) choose metrics for imbalance (e.g., precision/recall, F1, AUROC), (b) handle imbalance (thresholding, class weighting, or simple resampling), (c) select a decision threshold to hit a target F1, and (d) set up lightweight monitoring for drift after deployment. Provide concrete steps and commands you would use in a typical ML stack?</title>
