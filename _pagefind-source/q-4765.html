  <title>Design a KCA bootstrap for a city-wide fleet of autonomous delivery vehicles. Each vehicle boots with a hardware-backed root, attests to a regional bootstrap service, and enrolls a CSR to a central KCA that issues a short-lived mTLS client certificate (TTL 900s). Include per-vehicle SPIFFE IDs, cross-region trust anchors, auto-renewal on re-provision, revocation via OCSP/CRLs, offline root fallback, auditing, and a concise test plan with data flows?</title>
