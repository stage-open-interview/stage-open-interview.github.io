  <title>You&#039;re building an AWS-native pipeline to ingest training videos uploaded to S3 (MP4, up to 100 MB) for a streaming platform. On upload, design an event-driven flow that uses Rekognition Video for safety checks and label detection, Amazon Transcribe for spoken content, Amazon Translate to produce captions in English and Spanish, a SageMaker endpoint to generate a short video summary from the transcript, and store results in S3 with a compact index in DynamoDB (videoId, s3Key, durationMs, safeFlag, transcriptKey, captionsKeys, summaryKey). Include IAM, KMS, error handling, privacy controls, and cost considerations?</title>
