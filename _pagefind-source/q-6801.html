  <title>You manage a Unix host where logs are stored under /logs/host-*/service-*/log-YYYYMMDD-HH.log and rotated hourly into *.log.gz. Each line is either &#039;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS LEVEL: message&#039; or a JSON line with fields ts, msg, and possibly lvl. Write a robust one-liner (no external deps beyond standard UNIX tools) that reports, for the last 24 hours, the set of host/service pairs that had at least one ERROR, along with the count of distinct ERROR messages observed across both formats. Ensure it tolerates unreadable files and gz archives, and works when some hours are missing?</title>
