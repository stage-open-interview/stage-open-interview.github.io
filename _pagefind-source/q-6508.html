Design a minimal API surface and event schema to support point-in-time scoring across regions: include endpoints, an idempotent write mechanism, a region-scoped compute topic, and a GET for the latest score; also describe drift detection, backpressure, and a canary rollout plan, plus a simple audit log schema and region failover strategy?</title>
