  <title>Scenario: A navigation policy uses signals A..E with values in {T, F, U}. Time is discretized into two steps t=0 and t=1. Constraints: (A_t ∧ B_t) → C_t; (B_t ∨ D_t) → A_{t+1}; (¬E_t) → (A_t ∨ E_t). Is there an assignment with at least one U across both steps such that no constraint evaluates to F at either step? Outline a 3-valued backtracking approach that propagates across time and sketch a concrete footprint that satisfies all constraints?</title>
