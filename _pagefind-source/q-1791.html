  <title>You&#039;re building an Azure-native, multi-tenant data platform for real-time payments used by PayPal and Tesla. Ingest via Event Hubs, process with AKS and Functions, store in Delta Lake on ADLS Gen2, expose a data API. How would you enforce strict per-tenant isolation, achieve end-to-end exactly-once semantics across services, and implement a shadow-traffic ML model deployment with safe rollback and audit trails? Include architecture choices, data layouts, and failure modes?</title>
