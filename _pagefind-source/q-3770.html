  <title>Scenario: A telemetry inlet ingests events from numerous IoT devices. Each device’s events must be processed in arrival order, while events from different devices are handled concurrently by a small worker pool. Design a beginner-friendly Go solution using a bounded global queue and per-device FIFO channels to preserve per-device order. Add deduplication for repeated (deviceId,seq) pairs, implement backpressure, and ensure fairness when bursts occur. Provide a runnable sketch and brief testing plan?</title>
