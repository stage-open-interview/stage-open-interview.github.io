  <title>You&#039;re building a beginner Azure-based image processing workflow: a user uploads a photo to Azure Blob Storage. A Function App should trigger, resize the image into three thumbnails, store metadata in Cosmos DB with per-user partition keys, and publish a status message to Azure Service Bus. How would you implement idempotent processing, retries, and per-user isolation, with a minimal code sketch showing how to deduplicate on blob name and initiate the three resizes?</title>
