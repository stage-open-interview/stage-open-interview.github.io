  <title>Context: A high-throughput telemetry feed from a fleet of autonomous vehicles delivers events with a numeric priority and a timestamp. You must return a stable, fully sorted stream by priority under strict memory limits, processing blocks in place. Propose a practical in-place hybrid sort that uses 3-way quicksort with median-of-three pivots and a rotation-based in-place merge for adjacent blocks, plus an insertion sort threshold. Explain choices and expected complexities?</title>
