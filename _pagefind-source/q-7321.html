  <title>You&#039;re a beginner Azure data engineer tasked with building a cross-source ingestion for a marketing analytics product. Partner CSVs arrive via SFTP and internal JSONs via REST into ADLS Gen2 under /landing/marketing. Design a drift-tolerant ELT pipeline that stages raw data, upserts a Campaign dimension with SCD Type 1 and loads a Fact table with idempotent upserts into Azure Synapse, while creating Parquet-based stores for cost-efficient analytics. Include basic data quality gates (row counts, null rates) and register datasets in Purview with lineage. Outline components, steps, and testing strategy?</title>
