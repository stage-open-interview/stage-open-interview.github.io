  <title>Beginner CNF certification: In a multi-tenant CNF gateway platform on Kubernetes, implement a minimal end-to-end runtime policy gate using Open Policy Agent (OPA). Each tenant stores a small Rego policy in a ConfigMap that constrains which nodes and which egress CIDRs their CNFs may use. An admission webhook evaluates the policy during deployment; deployments failing policy are denied. Include a test namespace manifest to validate in isolation?</title>
