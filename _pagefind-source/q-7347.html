  <title>Scenario: A Linux host runs a microservice mesh with many containers. During load spikes, response latency intermittently jumps to 2-3s. The latency seems to shift between CPU saturation and log I/O contention. Using only default Linux tools, design a concrete diagnostic workflow to (1) confirm if latency is tied to log I/O or CPU cycles, (2) locate the container/process responsible for bursty log writes and file-descriptor pressure, (3) apply safe mitigations (e.g., separate log device, journald settings, cgroup tweaks) while preserving observability. Include exact commands and example outputs?</title>
