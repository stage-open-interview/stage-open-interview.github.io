Use Istio for traffic splitting, per-region Key Vault secrets, and region-scoped feature flags via Azure App Configuration. Implement a single reusable YAML template shared by regions, with region-specific approvals, health checks, telemetry correlation, auto-rollback on cross-region latency SLA breach, and cost controls via HPA and budget alerts.
