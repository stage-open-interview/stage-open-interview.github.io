  <title>In a three-region deployment (US-East, EU-Central, APAC) using a VXLAN EVPN fabric with ECMP across multiple transit providers, a new cross-region UDP telemetry stream shows sporadic tail latency spikes during mid-day while intra-region latency remains flat. A novel SRv6-based interconnect steers inter-region traffic with per-path SIDs. No app changes. Provide a concrete diagnostic plan to determine whether (a) SRv6 SID stack path selection causes cross-region asymmetry, (b) ECMP hashing across SRv6 tunnels, (c) MTU fragmentation on SRv6 encapsulation, or (d) SRv6 policy distribution delays are to blame, with exact commands and data to collect, and propose mitigations preserving telemetry reliability and cross-region performance?</title>
