  <title>In a two-site WAN (HQ and Data Center) connected by IPsec tunnels with NAT-T, a newly observed UDP telemetry stream from HQ to Data Center shows intermittent tail latency during peak hours while TCP/SSH latency remains normal. No app changes. Provide a concrete diagnostic plan to determine whether (a) underlay path asymmetry, (b) IPsec MTU/fragmentation, (c) NAT-T translation state, or (d) edge QoS/rate-limiting is to blame, with exact commands and data to collect, and propose mitigations that stabilize UDP telemetry without impacting other traffic?</title>
