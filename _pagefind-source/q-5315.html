  <title>Scenario: Global retailer emits orders and real-time pricing events into two AWS accounts across multiple regions. Design an end-to-end ingestion and governance pipeline that lands data in S3 as Parquet with daily partitions, registers in Glue Data Catalog (preferably Iceberg/Parquet), enforces strict access via Lake Formation, and supports schema evolution and data quality checks. Include services, data formats, partition strategy, and how you would validate end-to-end?</title>
