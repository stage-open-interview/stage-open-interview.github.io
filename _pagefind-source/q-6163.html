  <title>Design an external-memory sort for data too large to fit in RAM. With a memory buffer of size B, propose a two-phase approach: phase 1 generate sorted runs by reading B elements, sorting in memory, and writing runs; phase 2 perform a k-way merge of runs using a min-heap, loading blocks as needed. Provide precise I/O and time complexities and how to pick k and B given n?</title>
