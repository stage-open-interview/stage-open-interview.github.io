  <title>In a single Azure tenant hosting a multi-tenant SaaS app with per-tenant data in Azure SQL and a shared data lake, design a practical, rollback-safe guardrail to prevent cross-tenant data leakage during deployments. Your solution must (1) enforce tenant-scoped access with Azure Lighthouse and per-tenant Managed Identities, (2) isolate data using Row-Level Security and Dynamic Data Masking, (3) block cross-tenant config references via an Azure Policy gate, (4) support Canary deployments with feature flags and an automated rollback to the last good release, and (5) include monitoring, alerting, and a concrete rollout plan?</title>
