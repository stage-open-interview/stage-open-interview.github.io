  <title>Scenario: a directed graph with nonnegative weights and a fixed source S. Each batch updates up to B edges (increases or decreases). Propose a practical dynamic data structure to maintain exact distances from S to all nodes and answer distance queries S→T in polylog time, with sublinear amortized update time. Compare to rerunning Dijkstra after every batch; include expected bounds, memory usage, and practical heuristics?</title>
