  <title>Design a KCA workflow for a PCI-DSS constrained, multi-tenant payment processing platform that spans on-prem data centers and cloud regions for real-time fraud analytics. Edge devices and services boot with hardware-backed roots, attest to regional bootstrap services, and enroll a CSR to a central KCA that issues short-lived TLS certificates (TTL 900s) bound to per-tenant SPIFFE IDs and a &#039;payments&#039; scope. Include cross-region trust anchors, policy propagation with 2-minute renewals, offline revocation, auditing, and a test plan focusing on cross-tenant isolation and handshake latency under bursty payment traffic?</title>
