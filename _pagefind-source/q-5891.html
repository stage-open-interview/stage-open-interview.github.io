  <title>You&#039;re operating a multi-region, multi-tenant streaming platform on AWS. When a tenant&#039;s streams degrade under load, design an incident response and a scalable architecture that automatically detects the degradation, reroutes traffic to healthy edge locations, and isolates the tenant&#039;s data with per-tenant S3 buckets and IAM boundaries, using cross-account boundaries and SCPs. Specify concrete services (e.g., CloudWatch, Route 53, Lambda, Step Functions, MediaLive/MediaPackage, S3 replication, DynamoDB), monitoring, auto-remediation, data governance, and cost trade-offs. What would you implement first and why?</title>
