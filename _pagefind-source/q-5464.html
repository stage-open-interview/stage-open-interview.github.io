  <title>Outline a concrete, beginner-friendly test plan for a webhook gateway that accepts POST /webhooks, enqueues payloads, and retries failed deliveries with exponential backoff; cover unit tests for retry logic, integration tests with mocked endpoints, and end-to-end tests using an in-memory queue to observe retry behavior. Include sample payloads and expected outcomes (success, DLQ) and how 429/500 should be handled. What would your test plan look like?</title>
