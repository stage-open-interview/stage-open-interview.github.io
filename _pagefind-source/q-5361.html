  <title>Design a GCP-based end-to-end pipeline for a multi-tenant real-time fraud-detection service used by clients across Databricks, HashiCorp, and Zoom. Ingest events via Pub/Sub, compute streaming features with Dataflow, and retrain weekly in Vertex AI with per-tenant experiments. Enforce tenant isolation and data residency, store per-tenant artifacts in Cloud Storage and Feature Store, and auto-rollback to the last-good model for a tenant when a drift threshold is exceeded. Include data routing, dataset versioning, evaluation, and rollback triggers with concrete steps and cost considerations?</title>
