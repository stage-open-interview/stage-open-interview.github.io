  <title>You&#039;re fine-tuning a base 7B LLM to run on a 2GB-RAM edge device for a DoorDash driver assistant that answers questions about orders, routes, and policies. You have 20k anonymized transcripts for fine-tuning. Use adapters only (LoRA, QLoRA, or PEFT). Propose a concrete plan: where to inject adapters (which layers), rank/alpha, training hyperparameters under memory constraints, evaluation metrics (latency, accuracy), and deployment strategy including cloud fallback. Why this approach?</title>
