  <title>Within an enterprise multi-IdP setup (OIDC and SAML), you run an API gateway that issues short-lived JWTs for a service mesh. Propose a concrete bridge design that: (a) supports converting SAML assertions and OIDC tokens into token-bound JWTs with audience and scope constraints, (b) binds tokens to a device fingerprint and a one-time nonce, (c) supports PKCE-backed mobile/native flows and refresh token rotation, (d) provides revocation and token introspection across regions, and (e) prevents token replay in a globally distributed environment. Explain data flows, token formats, and security checks?</title>
