  <title>You&#039;re building a DoorDash-like app with real-time notifications. Design and implement an offline-friendly push-notification surface using a Rust-native module bridged to React Native that decodes a compact binary protocol and streams events to JS in order. Include: data model (Notification, Channel, ReadState, Expiry), bridging approach (JSI + TurboModules), guarantees (at-least-once delivery, ordering, dedup), a small hook useNotifications() and a minimal UI snippet that groups by Channel and shows unread badges; discuss trade-offs?</title>
