  <title>You&#039;re deploying a real-time anomaly detection system for a manufacturing line with multi-sensor streams (vibration, temperature, current) at 500 Hz. Anomalies are 0.1% of events. Design an end-to-end pipeline that (1) processes streaming data with feature extraction (time-domain and FFT-based features), (2) computes anomaly scores with a hybrid model (online autoencoder for detection + lightweight calibrator like gradient boosting), (3) handles concept drift with online retraining and drift detectors, (4) meets a latency budget under 10 ms per event on Nvidia GPUs, (5) includes monitoring, alerting, and a safe rollback plan. Include choices, evaluation protocol, and rollout strategy?</title>
