  <title>Design a TensorFlow 2.x data pipeline for a document-classification model trained on 8 GPUs with MirroredStrategy. Data comes from two sources: TFRecords with image_raw and a CSV with per-record numeric metadata. Build a single tf.data pipeline that yields a dict {&#039;image&#039;: image_tensor, &#039;meta&#039;: meta_tensor}, with image decoded and resized to 224x224 and scaled to [0,1], metadata normalized, deterministic per-epoch shuffling with a fixed seed, interleaving sources with parallelism, caching, and prefetching. Then implement gradient accumulation to reach a global batch size of 1024 while per-replica batch size is 128, and outline reproducibility checks and simple throughput measurements. Provide key code blocks?</title>
