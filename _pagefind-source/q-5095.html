  <title>Design an end-to-end ephemeral CNF lifecycle in a multi-cloud Kubernetes environment for a high-frequency risk-analysis CNF. The workflow must: (1) generate a short-lived SPIFFE identity tied to hardware-backed attestation (IMA/TPM) at boot, (2) produce a signed SBOM and a delta SBOM for each patch, (3) enforce runtime and admission policies via OPA/Kyverno to only allow CNFs with valid attestation and SBOM delta, (4) include a lightweight in-namespace test harness that verifies boot attestation, SBOM presence, and policy evaluation within 5 minutes of deployment, (5) outline rollback/revocation mechanics across clouds and tenants. Provide minimal config examples?</title>
