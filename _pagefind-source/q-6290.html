  <title>You&#039;re building an enterprise React Native app for on-device analytics that streams high-frequency sensor data (accelerometer/gyroscope) to a remote server. Design a native module (Rust via JSI bridge on iOS/Android) that samples at configurable rates, uses a ring buffer, caches locally with SQLite, and batches uploads when online. Include a JS hook useSensorStream() and a minimal UI snippet to visualize live metrics; discuss latency, battery, and privacy trade-offs?</title>
