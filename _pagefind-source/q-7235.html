  <title>Scenario: a Slack-like org with 6 squads across three time zones is issued a directive to cut MTTR by 60% and reduce post-release hotfix rate by 50% over 8 weeks, while preserving feature velocity. Propose a concrete plan: dual-track backlog (features vs reliability), capacity split (e.g., 70/20/10), cross-cutting owners (telemetry, incident mgmt, release engineering), rituals, metrics, tooling, and go/no-go criteria with milestones?</title>
