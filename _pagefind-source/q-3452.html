  <title>Beginner CNF certification: In a multi-tenant Kubernetes cluster, implement end-to-end config drift protection for CNF gateway deployments. Design a flow to (1) sign gateway configs with Cosign using a KMS-backed key and publish SBOMs, (2) mount a signed config as a per-tenant ConfigMap via a controller, (3) enforce at admission time that runtime config matches the signed artifact, and (4) surface per-tenant drift alerts with minimal in-namespace tests and sample manifests. What steps and minimal snippets would you provide?</title>
