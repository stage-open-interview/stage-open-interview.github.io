  <title>Scenario: You have a TensorFlow 2.x OCR model deployed as a Flask microservice on a CPU-only node. Under peak load, tail latency spikes and CPU contention rises. Design a practical setup to maintain deterministic latency (e.g., p95 &lt; 150 ms) while keeping CPU usage under 70%. Include (a) threading configuration with tf.config.threading.set_intra_op_parallelism_threads and set_inter_op_parallelism_threads, (b) a lightweight per-request batching or queuing strategy, and (c) metrics to validate performance. Provide a minimal Python snippet for the threading config and batcher, and discuss trade-offs?</title>
