  <title>Design a cross-platform native module for React Native that enables deterministic input replay for accessibility testing. It should record/timestamp touch events (single and multi-touch) on iOS and Android, run on a dedicated native thread, expose useInputReplay(roomId, { Hz, bufSize }) =&gt; { event, ts }, and provide a minimal React Native UI snippet to replay captured events on a canvas. Include backpressure by dropping oldest events to keep latency low and discuss memory, security, and jitter implications?</title>
