  <title>You&#039;re building a cross-platform React Native app that requires a native module &#039;TileCache&#039; to prefetch and cache map tiles for offline use. Outline the architecture, how the JavaScript bridge would interact with the iOS and Android implementations, memory management and eviction strategy, and a minimal code sketch showing the JS API and a native bridge interface to fetch a tile by z/x/y within a viewport.
