  <title>In a multi-tenant CNF platform on Kubernetes serving data-plane proxies for a fintech partner, design a runtime attestation workflow that enforces per-tenant trust before a CNF is allowed to handle traffic. The solution should extend prior provenance (image signing + SBOM) to include a small in-guest attestation agent that reports a runtime hash to a per-tenant attestation service. Describe: (1) how tenants produce and publish SBOMs and runtime attestations; (2) how an admission controller enforces both image signature and runtime attestation; (3) how keys are rotated with KMS; (4) a minimal one-namespace test to validate the end-to-end; (5) failure modes and mitigations?</title>
