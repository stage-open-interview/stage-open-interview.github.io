  <title>Design an Android module for a real-time collaborative AR drawing app using ARCore. Users place strokes anchored to real-world points, work offline with per-device encryption in Android Keystore, store to Room, and synchronize through a central backend with conflict-free merging via a CRDT graph of anchors and strokes. Provide data model, operation encoding, offline queue, and a concrete test plan for multi-user latency, drift, and audit trails?</title>
