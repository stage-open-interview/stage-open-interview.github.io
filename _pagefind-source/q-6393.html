  <title>In namespace telemetry, a StatefulSet named &#039;collector&#039; with 2 replicas uses a hostPath volume at /var/lib/collector and mounts /etc/collector from a ConfigMap. Provide a minimal manifest patch to: (1) switch the storage to a PVC backed by StorageClass &#039;fast-ssd&#039; mounted at /var/lib/collector, (2) mount the ConfigMap at /etc/collector with checksum/config annotation to trigger rolling restarts when the ConfigMap changes, (3) set resource requests/limits, (4) add a readinessProbe on /healthz and a livenessProbe on /livez, (5) run as non-root user 1000:1000, (6) create a PodDisruptionBudget to ensure at least 1 pod is available during disruptions. Include how you&#039;d verify under load and rollback?</title>
