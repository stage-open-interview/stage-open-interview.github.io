  <title>You must build a near-real-time ingestion pipeline for a payments analytics platform. Streams from Confluent Cloud (JSON/Avro with evolving schemas) are ingested into ADLS Gen2 via Databricks and Delta Lake. Implement schema drift tolerance, auto-evolving schemas, and idempotent upserts into a Delta Lake fact table, while late data is handled and end-to-end lineage is captured in Purview.
