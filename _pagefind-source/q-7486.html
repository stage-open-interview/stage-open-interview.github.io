  <title>You&#039;re the head of Platform Engineering at a data‑intensive financial tech firm. A regulator requires auditable data lineage from ingestion to every customer dashboard within 12 weeks. Propose a practical plan to make Platform a product: define internal contracts with SLAs, allocate capacity (60/25/15 for features, reliability, DevEx), appoint cross‑cutting owners (Observability, Data Lineage, Compliance), and run a 12‑week rollout with milestones and go/no‑go criteria. Include metrics, rituals, artifacts, and risk mitigations?</title>
