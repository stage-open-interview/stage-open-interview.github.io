  <title>You&#039;re building a real-time fraud-detection pipeline that ingests 200 features per transaction, with many outliers and missing values. You choose RPCA to reduce to 6 components for an online anomaly detector and a logistic classifier. Outline concrete steps: how to impute/mangle missing data for RPCA, how to handle heavy tails, how to select k using cross-validated reconstruction error with a complexity penalty, how RPCA would differ from standard PCA in this scenario, how to implement incremental RPCA updates (forgetting factor, windowed EM) in streaming, and how to map top loadings to business signals in a dashboard and detect component drift across batches?</title>
