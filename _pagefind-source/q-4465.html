  <title>On a dual-socket Linux server running a CPU-bound analytics workload, latency spikes occur under peak load even when CPU usage seems normal. Using only default tooling, design a concrete diagnostic workflow to (1) determine if the spike is NUMA memory locality, CPU throttling, or kernel I/O, (2) pinpoint the offending subsystem or process, and (3) apply a safe mitigation (e.g., bind memory/threads with numactl, isolate CPUs, or adjust memory policies) while preserving observability. Include exact commands and expected outputs?</title>
