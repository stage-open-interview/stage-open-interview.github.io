  <title>Design a data pipeline to ingest 2M GPU telemetry events per minute from a global fleet of AI training clusters into a data lake and a feature store. Events include host_id, region, timestamp, metric_type, and value. Requirements: immutable raw Parquet storage partitioned by region/hour; near-real-time metrics and anomaly alerts (1–2 minute latency) via a streaming engine; idempotent upserts into a feature store; schema evolution handling; late-arriving data; cost-aware storage/compute; monitoring and tests; compare Spark vs Flink for streaming components?</title>
