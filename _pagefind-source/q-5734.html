  <title>You&#039;re benchmarking a real-time personalization service: user profiles live in a MongoDB sharded cluster; recommendations are produced by a GPU-accelerated model served on Kubernetes with Nvidia GPUs. The system must sustain 120k–180k QPS with 99th percentile latency under 120 ms. Design a practical performance test plan that validates end-to-end latency, GPU throughput, and MongoDB tail latency, addressing data skew, caching, backpressure, circuit breakers, autoscaling, and multi-region failover. How would you do it?</title>
