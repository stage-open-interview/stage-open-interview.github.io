  <title>You are given a graph of tasks with dependencies as a directed graph (edge u -&gt; v means u must finish before v). Implement a function that, for any given graph, returns a valid build order if the graph is a DAG, or returns the first detected directed cycle as a list of node IDs. Use DFS with color marking to detect cycles and produce a topological sort for acyclic graphs. Provide a compact function signature and brief reasoning?</title>
