  <title>Design a lock-free, NUMA-aware concurrent hash map in C11 that supports inserts and lookups with bounded rehashing. Use epoch-based reclamation to retire nodes and avoid ABA. Describe per-bucket structure, CAS-based insert, and a safe resize strategy. Provide pseudo-code for insert and lookup, and a microbenchmark plan focusing on locality and contention across NUMA nodes. How would you validate correctness and performance?</title>
