  <title>Your Terraform repo uses a module called apps to deploy RDS instances per environment via for_each on environments (prod, staging, dev). A prod RDS instance was created manually and the resource address changed after a repo refactor to module.apps[&quot;prod&quot;].aws_db_instance.prod_db. Describe exact steps to detect drift with terraform plan -detailed-exitcode, move the existing prod resource from its old address to the new module address using terraform state mv, run a targeted apply to bring prod in line (e.g., terraform apply -target=module.apps[&quot;prod&quot;].aws_db_instance.prod_db), then re-run a full plan to confirm no drift. Include the exact addresses in your commands?</title>
