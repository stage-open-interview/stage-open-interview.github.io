  <title>Design a practical API-test plan for a multi-tenant image-processing service. The REST endpoint POST /v1/process/image returns a signed URL to the processed result. Create concrete test cases for: idempotent retries with an Idempotency-Key; streaming upload of large payloads; per-tenant routing and SLA verification across backends; failure modes (storage outage, worker pool exhaustion, network partition) with graceful fallbacks; and security checks for tenant scoping and signed URL expiry.
