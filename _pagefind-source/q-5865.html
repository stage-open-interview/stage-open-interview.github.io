  <title>Design a per-tenant dynamic prompt layer for a multi-tenant financial analytics assistant that personalizes prompts per user while guaranteeing strict data isolation and auditability. The system should support per-tenant persona hints and data-access constraints without leaking secrets, while staying latency-aware. Provide a concrete example of how the layer would compose prompts, including input-to-policy mapping and a minimal Python prototype to load tenant policy fragments and merge them with a base system prompt. What trade-offs and testing strategies would you use?</title>
