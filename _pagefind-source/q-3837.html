  <title>You&#039;re evaluating adding a real-time data quality monitoring microservice to a multi-region Lakehouse (Databricks-based) that tracks completeness, schema drift, and anomaly detection for streaming events (billions of events per day). Build a 2-year cost-benefit model including ingestion/processing costs, metadata storage, governance penalties avoided, uplift in downstream analytics accuracy, and operational overhead. Define break-even horizon and go/no-go criteria; include failure modes and mitigations?</title>
