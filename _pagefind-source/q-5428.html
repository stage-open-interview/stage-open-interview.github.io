  <title>On a Linux host running a single critical service with heavy disk I/O, latency spikes occur under load, yet CPU utilization and overall I/O wait seem inconclusive. Using only default Linux tools, design a concrete diagnostic workflow to determine whether the bottleneck is the IO scheduler, device queue depth, or page cache, and propose safe mitigations that preserve observability. Include exact commands and example outputs?</title>
