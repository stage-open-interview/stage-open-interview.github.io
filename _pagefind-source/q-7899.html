  <title>Design an end-to-end on-device fraud-detection system for a cross-platform payments feature used by millions on Meta/Plaid. Devices vary from low-end mobile to desktops. The solution must (1) select a device-appropriate model that meets sub-25 ms latency, (2) preserve privacy with on-device inference and optional DP/secure aggregation for updates, (3) provide regulatory explainability, and (4) handle concept drift with continuous evaluation and rolling retraining. Describe data schema, feature store, model choices, training pipeline (including quantization), evaluation protocol, rollout plan, and failure modes?</title>
