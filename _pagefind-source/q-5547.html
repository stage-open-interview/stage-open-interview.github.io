  <title>Design a KCA onboarding workflow for a hybrid HPC platform that runs confidential workloads inside hardware enclaves (like Intel SGX/TDX) across on-prem and cloud. Each enclave attests to a regional bootstrap service and enrolls a CSR to a central KCA, which issues a short-lived mTLS leaf certificate (TTL 300s) bound to a per-tenant SPIFFE ID and a data-classification scope. Include enclave-measurement binding, cross-cloud trust anchors, crypto agility (PQ readiness), offline revocation, auditing, and a test plan focusing on attestation latency and renewal under bursty workloads?</title>
