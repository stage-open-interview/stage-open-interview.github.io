  <title>You&#039;re deploying a Cloud Run service named status-api in us-central1 with two environments (dev and prod) using separate Cloud Run services. Design a minimal, Google-native setup focused on observability and cost control: tune autoscaling (min 0, max 300) and resource requests, emit a custom metric &#039;requests_per_second&#039; from the app to Cloud Monitoring, build/deploy from Artifact Registry, create a Cloud Monitoring dashboard for latency, error rate, and RPS, set an alert for 5xx rate &gt; 1% for 10 minutes, configure Cloud Billing budgets with alerts at $50 and $80, and ensure the deployment service account has least privilege (logs/metrics only). Include exact steps and code snippets for the metric, build/deploy, alert policies?</title>
