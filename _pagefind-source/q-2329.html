  <title>Design a bounded, concurrent router for a real-time analytics platform ingesting events from thousands of clients. Each client&#039;s events must be processed in arrival order, while events from different clients may be processed in parallel. The router should implement per-client backpressure and support clients joining/leaving on the fly. Describe two concrete implementations: (A) per-client queues with a central scheduler using locks, (B) per-client lock-free queues with a shared ready-list. Include correctness, failure handling, and a practical test plan?</title>
