  <title>Design a runtime-extensible snapshot policy system for an event-sourced service: policies decide when to capture a read-model snapshot based on criteria such as after N events, on a time interval, or when the event batch size exceeds a threshold. Implement with a design pattern that lets you add new snapshot strategies at runtime without touching the engine. Include minimal interfaces, a policy registry, and a usage example in your language of choice?</title>
