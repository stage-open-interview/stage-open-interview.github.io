  <title>You&#039;re evaluating a new on-device, privacy-preserving delivery-slot optimizer that runs a lightweight ML model on customers&#039; phones to suggest optimal delivery windows and assigns drivers, with periodic federated updates and no raw data leaves the device. Build an 18-month CBA: per-user model size, on-device compute and energy impact, federation bandwidth, update cadence, privacy/compliance costs, server-cost offsets from reduced telemetry, and expected business impact (on-time delivery, order value, driver utilization); include break-even horizon and go/no-go criteria?</title>
