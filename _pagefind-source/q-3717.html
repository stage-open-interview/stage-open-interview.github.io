  <title>Scenario: A multi-tenant web app runs on Cloud Run in a single GCP project for three brands. Docker images are supplied by external vendors. How would you enforce that only signed images can be deployed to Cloud Run using Binary Authorization, and ensure per-brand isolation so a signer can only deploy images for their tenant? Include policy details, image provenance, per-tenant constraints, testing with synthetic data, and rollback steps if a compromise is detected?</title>
