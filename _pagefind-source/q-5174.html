  <title>In a Terraform setup with two repos: network (VPCs and subnets) and app (container services), introduce a centralized observability stack that consumes VPC IDs and subnet IDs from the network repo as read-only data without coupling deployments. The observability stack must work per-environment (dev/stage/prod) and across regions. Describe a concrete implementation plan covering: (1) backend config per environment/region for state isolation, (2) data sources or remote_state usage to surface VPC/subnet IDs into the observability repo without coupling, (3) CI/CD gate logic to prevent promotion if plan would cause breaking changes to the observability inputs, (4) a minimal, non-breaking change to the network module to expose stable outputs and versioned schemas. Be explicit about backend keys, data source arguments, and how to extend to new regions?</title>
