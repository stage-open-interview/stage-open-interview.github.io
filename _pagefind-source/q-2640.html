  <title>Design a scalable KCA workflow to issue and rotate mTLS client certificates for 2,500 microservices deployed across six regions, each host with hardware-backed roots and attestation (TPM/TEE). Include CSR enrollment with hardware attestation, region-aware policy propagation via a streaming config service, cross-region trust anchors, short-lived leaf certs (5 minutes), automated renewal, revocation via OCSP/CRLs, offline root fallback, auditing, and a concrete 1-page test plan. Also provide a policy example and a migration path from a legacy PKI?</title>
