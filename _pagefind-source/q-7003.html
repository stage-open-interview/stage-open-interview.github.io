  <title>You&#039;re deploying a TensorFlow 2.x model that consumes both sparse categorical features and dense numeric features for real-time inference. To optimize latency, you plan to host embedding tables on CPU while keeping the rest of the model on GPU, exposed via a single SavedModel with two serving signatures: embeddings_only and full_inference. Describe the concrete steps to implement and serialize this, including input signatures, how to ensure deterministic outputs across replicas, and how you would validate latency and throughput in production?</title>
