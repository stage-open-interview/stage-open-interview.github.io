  <title>You’re evaluating a new Data Quality as a Service (DQaaS) layer for a lakehouse used by Snowflake, Uber, and Databricks. The plan is to run continuous profiling, schema drift detection, and automated remediation across 4 domains (orders, users, payments, events) with 3 prod regions. Build a 12–18 month cost-benefit model detailing profiling compute, metadata storage, alerting, remediation actions, and data egress; include break-even horizon, go/no-go criteria, and 3–5 concrete quality rules with thresholds?</title>
