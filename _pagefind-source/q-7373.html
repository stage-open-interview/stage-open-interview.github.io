  <title>You&#039;re deploying a TensorFlow 2.x image classifier behind TensorFlow Serving on Kubernetes. During burst traffic, tail latency spikes appear while average latency stays low. The model includes a CPU-bound preprocessing step (resize and crop) embedded in the graph, while inference runs on GPU. Describe a concrete plan to diagnose and mitigate tail latency, including: 1) whether to move preprocessing to the client or keep it in-graph, 2) how to configure TensorFlow Serving batching (max_batch_size, batch_timeout_micros, preferred_batch_sizes), 3) resource and threading changes (CPU/GPU cores, intra/op threads), 4) how to validate improvements with metrics and a minimal test plan?</title>
