  <title>Design an Azure OpenAI-powered content moderation assistant for a global platform. The system must route prompts to OpenAI or a fast retrieval-based model based on per-tenant safety policy scores, redact PII, enforce per-tenant data residency, log prompts/responses and policy decisions to Data Lake, and support dynamic policy updates via API Management. How would you architect end-to-end data paths, components, failure modes, and a practical test plan with latency targets and a policy-evaluation example?</title>
