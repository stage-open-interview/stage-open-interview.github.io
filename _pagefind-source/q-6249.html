  <title>In a distributed edge-accelerated CDN, a new feature lets developers deploy WebAssembly-based security checks at the edge. Describe how you would architect a secure, multi-tenant Wasm runtime that prevents cross-tenant data leakage, enforces code signing and attestation, supports per-tenant keys with an HSM, and implements runtime integrity monitoring with eBPF telemetry and SBOM verification. Include admission control, rotation, revocation, and incident playbooks. Name concrete tech choices and trade-offs?</title>
