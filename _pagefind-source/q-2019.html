  <title>Scenario: IoT sensors on factory floors emit JSON telemetry with evolving schemas (new metrics appear over time). Design a streaming ingestion pipeline that reads from Kinesis Data Streams, writes to S3 as Parquet with daily partitions, and uses an Iceberg catalog (Glue-backed) to handle schema evolution. Compare upsert strategies for late data (Iceberg MERGE INTO vs Hudi), outline data quality checks, and a testing plan including sandbox data and end-to-end validation. Include governance via Lake Formation?</title>
