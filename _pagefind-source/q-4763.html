  <title>In a Kubernetes deployment using TensorFlow Serving, you run a multi-tenant inference API where each tenant&#039;s models have separate versions and possibly different input shapes. Design an end-to-end solution that routes requests by tenantId to the correct model version, supports per-tenant latency targets, uses dynamic batching efficiently, handles model warmup/canary rollout, and provides monitoring/rollbacks. Be concrete about TF Serving config, gateway, and observability?</title>
