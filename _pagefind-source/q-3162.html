  <title>In a two-node docker-dca Swarm, deploy a TLS-enabled stateless API behind an Nginx edge proxy. Use Docker secrets for TLS certs, a Docker config for API endpoints, and a lightweight traffic-controller container that adjusts canary weights by updating a shared Nginx config mounted as a Docker config. Route 10% traffic to v2 initially, then scale to 100% per 15-second steps based on p95 latency measured via a small health-check endpoint; auto rollback to previous weight if latency exceeds 250ms for two consecutive checks. Provide exact docker commands and a docker-compose.yml skeleton, plus how to measure latency and trigger rollback?</title>
