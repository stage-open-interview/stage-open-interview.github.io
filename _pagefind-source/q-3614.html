  <title>On a Linux-like kernel using hazard-pointer-based reclamation for a shared in-memory index, writers replace entries by atomic pointer swaps and reclaim old nodes after a grace period. Describe a concrete interleaving on a 2-socket NUMA system that could cause a reader to observe a newly published but uninitialized node, and explain the required memory ordering to prevent it (publish with release, read with acquire, or use a ready flag). Propose a minimal fix and discuss trade-offs?</title>
