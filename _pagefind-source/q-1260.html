  <title>You&#039;re building a real-time cca analytics service that ingests 20k-50k events/sec from multiple microservices and external partners. It must deliver per-user engagement scores with sub-second latency, handle out-of-order and late data, deduplicate events, and support backfill. Describe the end-to-end architecture, data model, and exactly-once strategy, including how you&#039;d implement dedup, transactional writes, watermarking, and backfill testing under network partitions and clock skew?</title>
