  <title>Dynamic reachability indexing for DAGs: edges added in batches of size B; after each batch, build a (1+epsilon)-approximate reachability oracle using a dynamic two-hop labeling with k hubs. For every node u, store F(u) = {h in H | h reaches u} and for every node v, store B(v) = {h in H | v reaches h}. Reach(u,v) iff F(u) intersect B(v) is non-empty. After a batch, recompute labels only for nodes affected by new edges. Provide choices: hub selection, guarantees, update time, query time, memory, two optimizations, and a comparison to full recomputation. Use n=|V|, m=|E|, k, epsilon, B?</title>
