  <title>Scenario: You run a multi-tenant recommendation service on GCP with strict data residency for enterprise tenants. Each tenant has a separate offline feature store but shares a common feature namespace, and you must train per-tenant ranking models in Vertex AI. Design an end-to-end pipeline that ingests events via Pub/Sub, materializes features in Dataflow, trains and deploys models per-tenant endpoints, and serves real-time predictions. Include tenant isolation, data residency controls in Dataflow, drift detection, canary rollouts with automatic rollback, and per-tenant cost controls. Explain how you would test rollback, monitor drift, and handle schema evolution across tenants?</title>
