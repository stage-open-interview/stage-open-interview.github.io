  <title>You&#039;re running a Docker Swarm with services frontend, api, and worker. A feature-flag config is provided via Docker Config mounted at /etc/flags.json in all containers. You must rotate this config weekly with zero downtime. Describe the exact sequence of commands to create a new config version, rotate the services to use it, and implement a graceful reload inside apps so the new flags are picked up without losing requests. Include any Swarm update options you would tune?</title>
