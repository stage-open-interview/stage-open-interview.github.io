  <title>Design an Azure DevOps CI/CD workflow to promote a Databricks data processing job from development to production across two regions. The pipeline must: (1) build/pack notebook artifacts, (2) run Great Expectations data quality checks, (3) register data lineage in Azure Purview, (4) gate promotions with per-environment Key Vault secrets and policy approvals, (5) deploy via Databricks Jobs API to production, (6) log and audit all steps to Azure Monitor Logs, and (7) auto-rollback to the previous artifact on any data quality or job health failure. Include rollback strategy and metrics?</title>
