  <title>You&#039;re building a privacy-preserving, multi-tenant product-ranking model for a large grocery marketplace operating in dozens of regions. Data from each region must be isolated (per-region Feature Store, per-tenant IAM, and VPC Service Controls). Describe an end-to-end pipeline using Pub/Sub and Dataflow for ingestion, per-region offline training in Vertex AI Experiments with dataset/versioning and ML Metadata, and a private online-serving endpoint. Explain how to tag metadata in Data Catalog, implement per-region drift thresholds and region-level rollbacks with canary traffic shifts, and what auditing/logging you would keep. Include a concrete regional versioning scheme and rollback example?</title>
