  <title>You&#039;re building a real-time, multi-tenant Azure OpenAI-powered support chatbot for PayPal, MongoDB, and Two Sigma. You want canary deployments of two model variants (v1, v2) with automatic rollback on degradation, regional routing, and per-tenant quotas. Describe a concrete end-to-end approach: how you implement versioned deployments, traffic routing, governance, latency/quality monitoring, and rollback triggers using Azure OpenAI, API Management, Functions, Front Door, and Monitor. Include data flow and concrete metrics?</title>
