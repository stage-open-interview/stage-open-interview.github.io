  <title>Databricks beginner scenario: A streaming pipeline reads 2 TB/month of JSON events from S3 via Autoloader into Delta Lake. A downstream dashboard shows active_users by hour. Late events arrive up to 10 minutes. Design a practical plan to maintain accurate hourly active_user counts with minimal duplication, including: schema/partitioning for streaming, watermark-based late data handling, an idempotent MERGE into a Silver table, and a simple end-to-end test using synthetic late events. Also outline monitoring steps?</title>
